THE PREFACE


It hath been the wisdom of the Church of England, ever since the
first compiling of her Public Liturgy, to keep the mean between
the two extremes, of too much stiffness in refusing, and of too
much easiness in admitting any variation from it. For, as on the
one side common experience sheweth, that where a change hath been
made of things advisedly established (no evident necessity so
requiring) sundry inconveniences have thereupon ensued; and those
many times more and greater than the evils, that were intended to
be remedied by such change: So on the other side, the particular
Forms of Divine worship, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to
be used therein, being things in their own nature indifferent, and
alterable, and so acknowledged; it is but reasonable, that upon
weighty and important considerations, according to the various
exigency of times and occasions, such changes and alterations
should be made therein, as to those that are in place of Authority
should from time to time seem either necessary or expedient.
Accordingly we find, that in the Reigns of several Princes of
blessed memory since the Reformation, the Church, upon just and
weighty considerations her thereunto moving, hath yielded to make
such alterations in some particulars, as in their respective
times were thought convenient: Yet so, as that the main Body and
Essentials of it (as well in the chiefest materials, as in the
frame and order thereof) have still continued the same unto this
day, and do yet stand firm and unshaken, notwithstanding all the
vain attempts and impetuous assaults made against it, by such men
as are given to change, and have always discovered a greater
regard to their own private fancies and interests, than to that
duty they owe to the public.

By what undue means, and for what mischievous purposes the use of
the Liturgy (though enjoined by the Laws of the Land, and those
Laws never yet repealed) came, during the late unhappy confusions,
to be discontinued, is too well known to the world, and we are
not willing here to remember. But when, upon His Majesty's happy
Restoration, it seemed probable, that, amongst other things, the
use of the Liturgy also would return of course (the same having
never been legally abolished) unless some timely means were used
to prevent it; those men who under the late usurped powers had
made it a great part of their business to render the people
disaffected thereunto, saw themselves in point of reputation and
interest concerned (unless they would freely acknowledge themselves
to have erred, which such men are very hardly brought to do) with
their utmost endeavours to hinder the restitution thereof. In
order whereunto divers Pamphlets were published against the Book
of Common Prayer, the old Objections mustered up, with the addition
of some new ones, more than formerly had been made, to make the
number swell. In fine, great importunities were used to His Sacred
Majesty, that the said Book might be revised, and such Alterations
therein, and Additions thereunto made, as should be thought
requisite for the ease of tender Consciences: whereunto His
Majesty, out of his pious inclination to give satisfaction (so
far as could be reasonably expected) to all his subjects of what
persuasion soever, did graciously condescend.

In which review we have endeavoured to observe the like moderation,
as we find to have been used in the like case in former times.
And therefore of the sundry Alterations proposed unto us, we
have rejected all such as were either of dangerous consequence
(as secretly striking at some established Doctrine, or laudable
Practice of the Church of England, or indeed of the whole Catholic
Church of Christ) or else of no consequence at all, but utterly
frivolous and vain. But such Alterations as were tendered to us
(by what persons, under what pretences, or to what purpose soever
so tendered) as seemed to us in any degree requisite or expedient,
we have willingly, and of our own accord assented unto: not
enforced so to do by any strength of Argument, convincing us
of the necessity of making the said Alterations: For we are
fully persuaded in our judgements (and we here profess it to
the world) that the Book, as it stood before established by
Law, doth not contain in it any thing contrary to the Word of
God, or to sound Doctrine, or which a godly man may not with a
good Conscience use and submit unto, or which is not fairly
defensible against any that shall oppose the same; if it shall
be allowed such just and favourable construction as in common
Equity ought to be allowed to all human Writings, especially
such as are set forth by Authority, and even to the very best
translations of the holy Scripture itself.

Our general aim therefore in this undertaking was, not to gratify
this or that party in any their unreasonable demands; but to do
that, which to our best understandings we conceived might most
tend to the preservation of Peace and Unity in the Church; the
procuring of Reverence, and exciting of Piety and Devotion in
the Public Worship of God; and the cutting off occasion from
them that seek occasion of cavil or quarrel against the Liturgy
of the Church. And as to the several variations from the former
Book, whether by Alteration, Addition, or otherwise, it shall
suffice to give this general account, That most of the Alterations
were made, either first, for the better direction of them that
are to officiate in any part of Divine Service; which is chiefly
done in the Kalendars and Rubrics: Or secondly, for the more
proper expressing of some words or phrases of ancient usage in
terms more suitable to the language of the present times, and
the clearer explanation of some other words and phrases, that
were either of doubtful signification, or otherwise liable to
misconstruction: Or thirdly, for a more perfect rendering of
such portions of holy Scripture, as are inserted into the Liturgy;
which, in the Epistles and Gospels especially, and in sundry other
places, are now ordered to be read according to the last
Translation: and that it was thought convenient, that some
Prayers and Thanksgivings, fitted to special occasions, should
be added in their due places; particularly for those at Sea,
together with an office for the Baptism of such as are of Riper
Years: which, although not so necessary when the former Book
was compiled, yet by the growth of Anabaptism, through the
licentiousness of the late times crept in amongst us, is now
become necessary, and may be always useful for the baptizing of
Natives in our Plantations, and others converted to the Faith.
If any man, who shall desire a more particular account of the
several alterations in any part of the Liturgy, shall take the
pains to compare the present Book with the former; we doubt not
but the reason of the change may easily appear.

And having thus endeavoured to discharge our duties in this
weighty affair, as in the sight of God, and to approve our
sincerity therein (so far as lay in us) to the consciences
of all men; although we know it impossible (in such variety
of apprehensions, humours and interests, as are in the world)
to please all; nor can expect that men of factious, peevish,
and perverse spirits should be satisfied with any thing that
can be done in this kind by any other than themselves: Yet we
have good hope, that what is here presented, and hath been by
the Convocations of both Provinces with great diligence examined
and approved, will be also well accepted and approved by all
sober, peaceable, and truly conscientious Sons of the Church of
England.




CONCERNING THE SERVICE OF

THE CHURCH


There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or
so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been
corrupted: As, among other things, it may plainly appear by the
Common Prayers in the Church, commonly called _Divine Service_.
The first original and ground whereof if a man would search out
by the ancient Fathers, he shall find, that the same was not
ordained but of a good purpose, and for a great advancement of
godliness. For they so ordered the matter, that all the whole
Bible (or the greatest part thereof) should be read over once
every year; intending thereby, that the Clergy, and especially
such as were Ministers in the congregation, should (by often
reading, and meditation in God's word) be stirred up to godliness
themselves, and be more able to exhort others by wholesome
doctrine, and to confute them that were adversaries to the
truth; and further, that the people (by daily hearing of holy
Scripture read in the Church) might continually profit more and
more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inflamed with the
love of his true Religion.

But these many years passed, this godly and decent order of the
ancient Fathers hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by
planting in uncertain Stories, and Legends, with multitude of
Responds, Verses, vain Repetitions, Commemorations, and Synodals;
that commonly when any Book of the Bible was begun, after three
or four Chapters were read out, all the rest were unread. And
in this sort the Book of Isaiah was begun in _Advent_, and the
Book of Genesis in _Septuagesima_; but they were only begun, and
never read through: After like sort were other Books of holy
Scripture used. And moreover, whereas St Paul would have such
language spoken to the people in the Church, as they might
understand, and have profit by hearing the same; The Service in
this Church of England these many years hath been read in Latin
to the people, which they understand not; so that they have heard
with their ears only, and their heart, spirit, and mind, have not
been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithstanding that the
ancient Fathers have divided the Psalms into seven Portions,
whereof every one was called a _Nocturn:_ Now of late time a
few of them have been daily said, and the rest utterly omitted.
Moreover, the number and hardness of the Rules called the _Pie_,
and the manifold changings of the Service, was the cause, that to
turn the Book only was so hard and intricate a matter, that many
times there was more business to find out what should be read,
than to read it when it was found out.

These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set forth such
an Order, whereby the same shall be redressed. And for a readiness
in this matter, here is drawn out a Kalendar for that purpose,
which is plain and easy to be understood; wherein (so much as
may be) the reading of holy Scripture is so set forth, that
all things shall be done in order, without breaking one piece
from another. For this cause be cut off Anthems, Responds,
Invitatories, and such like things as did break the continual
course of the reading of the Scripture.

Yet, because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must
be some Rules; therefore certain Rules are here set forth; which,
as they are few in number, so they are plain and easy to be
understood. So that here you have an Order for Prayer, and for
the reading of the holy Scripture, much agreeable to the mind
and purpose of the old Fathers, and a great deal more profitable
and commodious, than that which of late was used. It is more
profitable, because here are left out many things, whereof some
are untrue, some uncertain, some vain and superstitious; and
nothing is ordained to be read, but the very pure Word of God,
the holy Scriptures, or that which is agreeable to the same;
and that in such a Language and Order as is most easy and plain
for the understanding both of the Readers and Hearers. It is also
more commodious, both for the shortness thereof, and for the
plainness of the Order, and for that the Rules be few and easy.

And whereas heretofore there hath been great diversity in saying
and singing in Churches within this Realm; some following Salisbury
Use, some Hereford Use, and some the Use of Bangor, some of York,
some of Lincoln; now from henceforth all the whole Realm shall
have but one Use.

And forasmuch as nothing can be so plainly set forth, but doubts
may arise in the use and practice of the same; to appease all
such diversity (if any arise) and for the resolution of all
doubts, concerning the manner how to understand, do, and execute,
the things contained in this Book; the parties that so doubt, or
diversely take any thing, shall alway resort to the Bishop of the
Diocese, who by his discretion shall take order for the quieting
and appeasing of the same; so that the same order be not contrary
to any thing contained in this Book. And if the Bishop of the
Diocese be in doubt, then he may send for the resolution thereof
to the Archbishop.

Though it be appointed, That all things shall be read and sung in
the Church in the English Tongue, to the end that the Congregation
may be thereby edified; yet it is not meant, but that when men
say Morning and Evening Prayer privately, they may say the same
in any language that they themselves do understand.

And all Priests and Deacons are to say daily the Morning and
Evening Prayer either privately or openly, not being let by
sickness, or some other urgent cause.

And the Curate that ministereth in every Parish Church or Chapel,
being at home, and not being otherwise reasonably hindered,
shall say the same in the Parish Church or Chapel where he
ministereth, and shall cause a Bell to be tolled thereunto a
convenient time before he begin, that the people may come to
hear God's Word, and to pray with him.




OF CEREMONIES,

WHY SOME BE ABOLISHED, AND SOME RETAINED


Of such Ceremonies as be used in the Church, and have had their
beginning by the institution of man, some at the first were of
godly intent and purpose devised, and yet at length turned to
vanity and superstition: some entered into the Church by undiscreet
devotion, and such a zeal as was without knowledge; and for
because they were winked at in the beginning, they grew daily to
more and more abuses, which not only for their unprofitableness,
but also because they have much blinded the people, and obscured
the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and clean rejected:
other there be, which although they have been devised by man, yet
it is thought good to reserve them still, as well for a decent
order in the Church, (for the which they were first devised) as
because they pertain to edification, whereunto all things done in
the Church (as the Apostle teacheth) ought to be referred.

And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony, in itself
considered, is but a small thing; yet the wilful and contemptuous
transgression and breaking of a common order and discipline is
no small offence before God, _Let all things be done among you_,
saith Saint Paul, _in a seemly and due order:_ The appointment of
the which order pertaineth not to private men; therefore no man
ought to take in hand, nor presume to appoint or alter any public
or common Order in Christ's Church, except he be lawfully called
and authorized thereunto.

And whereas in this our time, the minds of men are so diverse,
that some think it a great matter of conscience to depart from a
piece of the least of their Ceremonies, they be so addicted to
their old customs; and again on the other side, some be so
new-fangled, that they would innovate all things, and so despise
the old, that nothing can like them, but that is new: it was
thought expedient, not so much to have respect how to please
and satisfy either of these parties, as how to please God, and
profit them both. And yet lest any man should be offended, whom
good reason might satisfy, here be certain causes rendered, why
some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away, and some retained
and kept still.

Some are put away, because the great excess and multitude of them
hath so increased in these latter days, that the burden of them
was intolerable; whereof Saint Augustine in his time complained,
that they were grown to such a number, that the estate of Christian
people was in worse case concerning that matter, than were the
Jews. And he counselled that such yoke and burden should be taken
away, as time would serve quietly to do it. But what would Saint
Augustine have said, if he had seen the Ceremonies of late days
used among us; whereunto the multitude used in his time was not
to be compared? This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies was
so great, and many of them so dark, that they did more confound
and darken, than declare and set forth Christ's benefits unto us.
And besides this, Christ's Gospel is not a Ceremonial Law, (as
much of Moses' Law was,) but it is a Religion to serve God, not
in bondage of the figure or shadow, but in the freedom of the
Spirit; being content only with those Ceremonies which do serve
to a decent Order and godly Discipline, and such as be apt to
stir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to
God, by some notable and special signification, whereby he might
be edified. Furthermore, the most weighty cause of the abolishment
of certain Ceremonies was, That they were so far abused, partly
by the superstitious blindness of the rude and unlearned, and
partly by the unsatiable avarice of such as sought more their
own lucre, than the glory of God, that the abuses could not well
be taken away, the thing remaining still.

But now as concerning those persons, which peradventure will be
offended, for that some of the old Ceremonies are retained still:
If they consider that without some Ceremonies it is not possible
to keep any Order, or quiet Discipline in the Church, they shall
easily perceive just cause to reform their judgements. And if
they think much, that any of the old do remain, and would rather
have all devised anew: then such men granting some Ceremonies
convenient to be had, surely where the old may be well used,
there they cannot reasonably reprove the old only for their age,
without bewraying of their own folly. For in such a case they
ought rather to have reverence unto them for their antiquity, if
they will declare themselves to be more studious of unity and
concord, than of innovations and new-fangleness, which (as much
as may be with the true setting forth of Christ's Religion) is
always to be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall have no just cause
with the Ceremonies reserved to be offended. For as those be taken
away which were most abused, and did burden men's consciences
without any cause; so the other that remain, are retained for a
discipline and order, which (upon just causes) may be altered
and changed, and therefore are not to be esteemed equal with
God's Law. And moreover, they be neither dark nor dumb Ceremonies,
but are so set forth, that every man may understand what they do
mean, and to what use they do serve. So that it is not like that
they in time to come should be abused as other have been. And in
these our doings we condemn no other Nations, nor prescribe any
thing but to our own people only: For we think it convenient that
every Country should use such Ceremonies as they shall think best
to the setting forth of God's honour and glory, and to the reducing
of the people to a most perfect and godly living, without error or
superstition; and that they should put away other things, which
from time to time they perceive to be most abused, as in men's
ordinances it often chanceth diversely in divers countries.




THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED

TO BE READ


The Psalter shall be read through once every Month, as it is there
appointed, both for Morning and Evening Prayer. But in _February_
it shall be read only to the twenty-eighth, or twenty-ninth day of
the Month.

And, whereas _January_, _March_, _May_, _July_, _August_, _October_,
and _December_ have One-and-thirty days apiece; It is ordered,
that the same Psalms shall be read the last day of the said months,
which were read the day before: So that the Psalter may begin
again the first day of the next month ensuing.

And, whereas the 119th Psalm is divided into twenty-two portions,
and is over-long to be read at one time; It is so ordered, that
at one time shall not be read above four or five of the said
portions.

And at the end of every Psalm, and of every such part of the
119th Psalm, shall be repeated this Hymn,

_Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen._

Note, that the Psalter followeth the Division of the Hebrews,
and the Translation of the great English Bible, set forth and
used in the time of King Henry the Eighth, and Edward the Sixth.




THE ORDER HOW THE REST OF HOLY

SCRIPTURE IS APPOINTED TO BE READ


The Old Testament is appointed for the First Lessons at Morning
and Evening Prayer, so as the most part thereof will be read
every year once, as in the Kalendar is appointed.

The New Testament is appointed for the Second Lessons at Morning
and Evening Prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year
twice, once in the morning and once in the evening, besides the
Epistles and Gospels, except the Apocalypse, out of which there
are only certain Lessons appointed at the end of the year, and
certain Proper Lessons appointed upon divers feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day, look for the
day of the Month in the Kalendar following, and there ye shall
find the chapters and portions of chapters that shall be read
for the Lessons, both at Morning and Evening Prayer, except only
the moveable feasts, which are not in the Kalendar, and the
immoveable, where there is a blank left in the column of Lessons,
the Proper Lessons for all which days are to be found in the
Table of Proper Lessons.

If Evening Prayer is said at two different times in the same
place of worship on any Sunday (except a Sunday for which
alternative Second Lessons are specially appointed in the Table,)
the Second Lesson at the second time may, at the discretion of
the minister, be any chapter from the four Gospels, or any
Lesson appointed in the Table of Lessons from the four Gospels.

Upon occasions, to be approved by the Ordinary, other Lessons may,
with his consent, be substituted for those which are appointed in
the Kalendar.

And note, That whensoever Proper Psalms or Lessons are appointed,
then the Psalms and Lessons of ordinary course appointed in the
Psalter and Kalendar (if they be different) shall be omitted for
that time.

Note also, That upon occasions to be appointed by the Ordinary,
other Psalms may, with his consent, be substituted for those
appointed in the Psalter.

If any of the Holy-days for which Proper Lessons are appointed in
the Table fall upon a Sunday which is the first Sunday in Advent,
Easter-day, Whitsunday, or Trinity Sunday, the Lessons appointed
for such Sunday shall be read, but if it fall upon any other
Sunday, the Lessons appointed either for the Sunday or for the
Holy-day may be read at the discretion of the minister.

Note also, That the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel appointed for
the Sunday shall serve all the week after, where it is not in
this Book otherwise ordered.






PROPER LESSONS

The numbers here prefixed to the several days, between the
twenty-first day of March and the eighteenth day of April, both
inclusive, denote the days upon which those Full Moons do fall,
which happen upon or next after the twenty-first day of March, in
those years, of which they are respectively the Golden Numbers:
And the Sunday Letter next following any such full Moon points
out Easter-day for that year. All which holds until the year of
our Lord 2199 inclusive; after which year, the places of these
Golden Numbers will be changed.

twenty-first day of March and the eighteenth day of April, both
inclusive, denote the days upon which those Full Moons do fall,
which happen upon or next after the twenty-first day of March, in
those years, of which they are respectively the Golden Numbers:
And the Sunday Letter next following any such full Moon points
out Easter-day for that year. All which holds until the year of

THE ORDER FOR

MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

DAILY TO BE SAID AND USED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR


Morning and Evening Prayer shall be used in the accustomed place
of the Church, Chapel, or Chancel; except it shall be otherwise
determined by the Ordinary of the place. And the Chancels shall
remain as they have done in times past.

And here is to be noted, that such Ornaments of the Church, and
of the Ministers thereof at all times of their Ministration,
shall be retained, and be in use, as were in this Church of
England by the Authority of Parliament, in the Second Year of
the Reign of King Edward the Sixth.



REQUESTS FOR THE PRAYERS OF THE CONGREGATION

| _When the prayers of the congregation are desired on behalf of_
| _sick persons, sufferers from any public calamity, or others,_
| _the Minister may give notice of the same before he begins the_
| _Litany, and may insert the words_ especially those for whom our
| prayers are desired _in the relative suffrage to which the case_
| _is appropriate. Such notice may also be given at Morning or_
| _Evening Prayer before any prayers after the Third Collect are_
| _said, or in the Holy Communion before the Prayer for the_
| _whole state of Christ's Church is said_.
|
| _And, when prayer is desired on behalf of any sick person, the_
| _Minister may during Divine Service use the Collect appointed_
| _for the Communion of the Sick, inserting after the words_
| visited with thine hand _the words_ for whom our prayers are
| desired, _or he may use any of the prayers in the Order for_
| _the Visitation of the Sick, as the case may seem to him to_
| _require_.




THE ORDER FOR

MORNING PRAYER

DAILY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR


_At the beginning of Morning Prayer the Minister shall read with
a loud voice some one or more of these Sentences of the Scriptures
that follow. And then he shall say that which is written after
the said Sentences_.

When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he
hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he
shall save his soul alive. _Ezek_. xviii. 27.

I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
_Psalm_ li. 3.

Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
_Psalm_ li. 9.

The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. _Psalm_ li. 17.

Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord
your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. _Joel_ ii. 13.

To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
have rebelled against him: neither have we obeyed the voice of
the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us.
_Dan_. ix. 9, 10.

Lord, correct me, but with judgement; not in thine anger, lest
thou bring me to nothing. _Jer_. x. 24. _Psalm_ vi. 1.

Repent ye; for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand. _St Matth_. iii. 2.

I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more
worthy to be called thy son. _St Luke_ xv. 18, 19.

Enter not into judgement with thy servant, O Lord; for in thy
sight shall no man living be justified. _Psalm_ cxliii. 2.

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us: but if we confess our sins, he is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. 1 _St John_ i. 8, 9.

| _These sentences of Scripture may be used at the beginning of_
| _Morning Prayer at the Great Festivals_.
|
| _Christmas-day and seven days after_.
|
| Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour which
| is Christ the Lord. _St Luke_ ii. 11.
|
| _Easter-day and seven days after_.
|
| The Lord is risen indeed. Alleluia. _St Luke_ xxiv. 34.
|
| _Ascension-day and seven days after_.
|
| Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
| doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. _Psalm_ xxiv. 7.
|
| _Or_, We have a great high priest that is passed into the
| heavens, Jesus the Son of God. Let us therefore come boldly
| unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
| grace to help in time of need. _Heb_. iv. 14, 16.
|
| _Whitsunday and six days after_.
|
| When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
| one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from
| heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
| where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven
| tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and
| they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. _Acts_ ii. 1-4.

Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us in sundry places
to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and
that we should not dissemble nor cloke them before the face of
Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble,
lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain
forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And
although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins
before God; yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble
and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that
we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy
praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things
which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the
soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as are here
present, to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice unto
the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me:

| _The exhortation_, Dearly beloved brethren, _except on occasions_
| _specified by the Bishop, may be omitted, or may be abbreviated_
| _as follows:_
|
| Dearly beloved brethren, I pray and beseech you, as many as are
| here present, to accompany me with a pure heart and humble
| voice unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me;
|
| _Or the following may be said instead_,
|
| Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.

_A general Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after
the Minister, all kneeling_.

Almighty and most merciful Father, We have erred and strayed
from thy ways like lost sheep, We have followed too much the
devices and desires of our own hearts, We have offended against
thy holy laws, We have left undone those things which we ought
to have done, And we have done those things which we ought not
to have done, And there is no health in us: But thou, O Lord,
have mercy upon us miserable offenders; Spare thou them, O God,
which confess their faults, Restore thou them that are penitent,
According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesu
our Lord: And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, That
we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the
glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

_The Absolution or Remission of sins to be pronounced by the
Priest alone, standing: the people still kneeling_.

Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth
not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his
wickedness and live; and hath given power and commandment to his
Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,
the Absolution and Remission of their sins: He pardoneth and
absolveth all them that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his
holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true
repentance and his Holy Spirit, that those things may please him
which we do at this present, and that the rest of our life
hereafter may be pure and holy; so that at the last we may come
to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

_The people shall answer here, and at the end of all other prayers_,

Amen.

_Then the Minister shall kneel, and say the Lord's Prayer with an
audible voice: the people also kneeling, and repeating it with him,
both here, and wheresoever else it is used in Divine Service_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As
we forgive them that trespass against us; And lead us not into
temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.

_Then likewise he shall say_,

O Lord, open thou our lips.

_Answer_. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

_Priest_. O God, make speed to save us.

_Answer_. O Lord, make haste to help us.

_Here, all standing up, the Priest shall say_,

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

_Answer_. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
world without end. Amen.

_Priest_. Praise ye the Lord.

_Answer_. The Lord's Name be praised.

_Then shall be said or sung this Psalm following: Except on
Easter-day, upon which another Anthem is appointed: and on the
nineteenth day of every month it is not to be read here, but in
the ordinary course of the Psalms_.

| _The Easter Anthems may be used for seven days after Easter_.

VENITE, EXULTEMUS DOMINO.

Psalm xcv.

O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation.

Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew
ourselves glad in him with psalms.

For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.

In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of
the hills is his also.

The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.

O come, let us worship, and fall down: and kneel before the Lord
our Maker.

For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture,
and the sheep of his hand.

To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;

When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.

Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It
is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known
my ways.

Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my
rest.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Then shall follow the Psalms in order as they be appointed. And
at the end of every Psalm throughout the year, and likewise in
the end of_ Benedicite, Benedictus, Magnificat, _and_ Nunc
dimittis, _shall be repeated_,

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

_Answer_. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
world without end. Amen.

_Then shall be read distinctly with an audible voice the First
Lesson, taken out of the Old Testament as is appointed in the
Kalendar: Except there be proper Lessons assigned for that day:
He that readeth so standing and turning himself, as he may best

or sung, in English, the Hymn called_ Te Deum Laudamus, _daily
throughout the year_.

_Note that before every Lesson the Minister shall say_, Here
beginneth such a Chapter, _or_ Verse of such a Chapter, of
such a Book: _And after every Lesson_, Here endeth the First,
_or_ the Second Lesson,

TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.

We praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.

All the earth doth worship thee: the Father everlasting.

To thee all Angels cry aloud: the heavens and all the powers
therein.

Thou art the King of glory: O Christ.

Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father.

When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou didst not abhor
the Virgin's womb.

When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death: thou didst open
the kingdom of heaven to all believers.

Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father.

We believe that thou shalt come: to be our Judge.

We therefore pray thee, help thy servants: whom thou hast redeemed
with thy precious blood.

Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting.

O Lord, save thy people: and bless thine heritage.

Govern them: and lift them up for ever.

Day by day: we magnify thee;

And we worship thy Name: ever world without end.

_Then shall be read in like manner the Second Lesson, taken out
of the New Testament. And after that the Hymn following: Except
when that shall happen to be read in the Chapter for the day, or
for the Gospel on Saint John Baptist's Day_.

BENEDICTUS.

St Luke i. 68.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: for he hath visited, and
redeemed his people;

And hath raised up a mighty salvation for us: in the house of
his servant David;

As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets: which have been
since the world began;

That we should be saved from our enemies: and from the hands of
all that hate us;

To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers: and to remember
his holy covenant;

To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham: that
he would give us;

That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies: might
serve him without fear;

In holiness and righteousness before him: all the days of our life.

And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: for
thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

To give knowledge of salvation unto his people: for the remission
of their sins;

Through the tender mercy of our God: whereby the day-spring from
on high hath visited us;

To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of
death: and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Or this Psalm_,

JUBILATE DEO.

Psalm c.

O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with
gladness, and come before his presence with a song.

Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us,
and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
pasture.

O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his
courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and speak good of
his Name.

For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth
endureth from generation to generation.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Then shall be sung or said the Apostles Creed, by the Minister
and the people standing: Except only such days as the Creed of
Saint Athanasius is appointed to be read_.

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was conceived by
the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius
Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell;
The third day he rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven,
And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; From
thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Catholic Church; The
Communion of Saints; The Forgiveness of sins; The Resurrection
of the body, And the life everlasting. Amen.

_And after that, these Prayers following, all devoutly kneeling:
the Minister first pronouncing with a loud voice_,

The Lord be with you.

_Answer_. And with thy spirit.

_Minister_. Let us pray.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Then the Minister, Clerks, and people shall say the Lord's Prayer
with a loud voice_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Then the Priest standing up shall say_,

O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us.

_Answer_. And grant us thy salvation.

_Priest_. O Lord, save the King.

_Answer_. And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.

_Priest_. Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.

_Answer_. And make thy chosen people joyful.

_Priest_. O Lord, save thy people.

_Answer_. And bless thine inheritance.

_Priest_. Give peace in our time, O Lord.

_Answer_. Because there is none other that fighteth or us, but
only thou, O God.

_Priest_. O God, make clean our hearts within us.

_Answer_. And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.

_Then shall follow three Collects: The first of the day, which
shall be the same that is appointed at the Communion: The second
for Peace: The third for Grace to live well. And the two last
Collects shall never alter, but daily be said at Morning Prayer
throughout all the year, as followeth, all kneeling_.

_The Second Collect, for Peace_.

O God, who art the author of peace and lover of concord, in
knowledge of whom standeth our eternal life, whose service is
perfect freedom: Defend us thy humble servants in all assaults
of our enemies; that we, surely trusting in thy defence, may not
fear the power of any adversaries; through the might of Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

_The Third Collect, for Grace_.

O Lord our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who
hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day: Defend us
in the same with thy mighty power; and grant that this day we
fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that
all our doings may be ordered by thy governance, to do always
that is righteous in thy sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

_In Quires and Places where they sing here followeth the Anthem_.

_Then these five Prayers following are to be read here: Except
when the Litany is read; and then only the two last are to be
ready as they are there placed_.

_A Prayer for the King's Majesty_.

O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings,
Lord of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy
throne behold all the dwellers upon earth: Most heartily we
beseech thee with thy favour to behold our most gracious Sovereign
Lord, King _GEORGE_, and so replenish him with the grace of thy
Holy Spirit, that he may alway incline to thy will, and walk in
thy way: Endue him plenteously with heavenly gifts; grant him in
health and wealth long to live; strengthen him that he may
vanquish and overcome all his enemies, and finally after this
life he may attain everlasting joy and felicity; through Jesus
Christ our Lord, _Amen_.

_A Prayer for the Royal Family_.

Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech
thee to bless our gracious Queen _Mary_, _Alexandra_ the Queen
Mother, _Edward_ Prince of Wales, and all the Royal Family: Endue
them with thy Holy Spirit; enrich them with thy heavenly grace;
prosper them with all happiness; and bring them to thine ever
lasting kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

| _The following Prayer may be said at Morning Prayer, for the_
| _King, the Royal Family, the Ministers of the Crown, the_
| _Parliament_ (_when in session_), _and those in authority,_
| _instead of the Prayers_ For the King's Majesty, For the Royal
| Family, _and_ For the High Court of Parliament; _but always_
| _either the following Prayer, or those above noted, shall be_
| _used, together with the_ Prayer for the Clergy and People,
| _the_ Prayer of St Chrysostom, _and_ the Grace, _unless the_
| _Litany be said_.
|
| O Lord God of our fathers, who rulest the nations of the earth;
| Most heartily we beseech thee with thy favour to behold our
| Sovereign Lord, King _GEORGE_, that he may alway incline to thy
| will and walk in thy way; and together with him bless our
| gracious Queen _Mary_, _Alexandra_ the Queen Mother, _Edward_
| Prince of Wales, and all the Royal Family. Endue with wisdom
| the Ministers of the Crown, [the High Court Of Parliament at
| this time assembled *,] and those who are set in authority over
| us, that all things may be so ordered and settled by their
| endeavours, that peace and happiness, truth and justice,
| religion and piety, may be established among us for all
| generations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| [Margin Note] *to be said when the Parliament is in Session.

_A Prayer for the Clergy and People_.

Almighty and everlasting God, who alone workest great marvels:
Send down upon our Bishops and Curates, and all Congregations
committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace;
and that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual
dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honour of our
Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

_A Prayer of Saint Chrysostom_.

Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one
accord to make our common supplications unto thee; and dost
promise that when two or three are gathered together in thy
Name thou wilt grant their requests: Fulfil now, O Lord, the
desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient
for them; granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and
in the world to come life everlasting. _Amen_.

2 _Corinthians_ xiii.

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. _Amen_.


_Here endeth the Order of Morning Prayer throughout the Year_.




THE ORDER FOR

EVENING PRAYER

DAILY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR


_At the beginning of Evening Prayer the Minister shall read with
a loud voice some one or more of these Sentences of the Scriptures
that follow. And then he shall say that which is written after the
said Sentences_.

When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath
committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save
his soul alive. _Ezek_. xviii. 27.

I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
_Psalm_ li. 3.

Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
_Psalm_ li. 9.

The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. _Psalm_ li. 17.

Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your
God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. _Joel_ ii. 13.

To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
have rebelled against him: neither have we obeyed the voice of the
Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us. _Dan_.
ix. 9, 10.

O Lord, correct me, but with judgement; not in thine anger, lest
thou bring me to nothing. _Jer_. x. 24. _Psalm_ vi. 1.

Repent ye; for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand. _St Matth_. iii. 2.

I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I
have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy
to be called thy son. _St Luke_ xv. 18, 19.

Enter not into judgement with thy servant, O Lord; for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified. _Psalm_ cxliii. 2.

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth
is not in us: but if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 _St John_ i. 8, 9.

| _These sentences of Scripture may be used at the beginning of_
| _Evening Prayer at the Great Festivals_.
|
| _Christmas-day and seven days after_.
|
| Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour which
| is Christ the Lord. _St Luke_ ii. 11.
|
| _Easter-day and seven days after_.
|
| The Lord is risen indeed. Alleluia. _St Luke_ xxiv. 34.
|
| _Ascension-day and seven days after_.
|
| Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
| doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. _Psalm_ xxiv. 7.
|
| _Or_, We have a great high priest that is passed into the
| heavens, Jesus the Son of God. Let us therefore come boldly
| unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
| grace to help in time of need. _Heb_. iv. 14, 16.
|
| _Whitsunday and six days after_.
|
| When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
| one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from
| heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
| where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven
| tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and they
| were all filled with the Holy Ghost. _Acts_ ii. 1-4.

Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us in sundry places
to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and
that we should not dissemble nor cloke them before the face of
Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble,
lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain
forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And
although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins
before God; yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble
and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that we
have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise,
to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are
requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul.
Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present,
to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice unto the
throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me:

| _The exhortation_, Dearly beloved brethren, _except on occasions_
| _specified by the Bishop, may be omitted, or may be abbreviated_
| _as follows_:
|
| Dearly beloved brethren, I pray and beseech you, as many as
| are here present, to accompany me with a pure heart and humble
| voice unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me;
|
| _Or the following may be said instead_,
|
| Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.

_A general Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after
the Minister, all kneeling_.

Almighty and most merciful Father, We have erred and strayed from
thy ways like lost sheep, We have followed too much the devices
and desires of our own hearts, We have offended against thy holy
laws, We have left undone those things which we ought to have
done, And we have done those things which we ought not to have
done, And there is no health in us: But thou, O Lord, have mercy
upon us miserable offenders; Spare thou them, O God, which
confess their faults, Restore thou them that are penitent,
According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesu
our Lord: And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, That
we may here after live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To
the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

_The Absolution or Remission of sins to be pronounced by the
Priest alone, standing: the people still kneeling_.

Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth
not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his
wickedness and live; and hath given power and commandment to his
Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,
the Absolution and Remission of their sins: He pardoneth and
absolveth all them that truly repent and unfeignedly believe
his holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true
repentance and his Holy Spirit, that those things may please him
which we do at this present, and that the rest of our life
hereafter may be pure and holy; so that at the last we may
come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then the Minister shall kneel, and say the Lord's Prayer: the
people also kneeling, and repeating it with him_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven, Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power,
and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.

_Then likewise he shall say_,

O Lord, open thou our lips.

_Answer_. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

_Priest_. O God, make speed to save us.

_Answer_. O Lord, make haste to help us.

_Here, all standing up, the Priest shall say_,

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

_Answer_. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
world without end. Amen.

_Priest_. Praise ye the Lord.

_Answer_. The Lord's Name be praised.

_Then shall be said or sung the Psalms in order as they be
appointed. Then a Lesson of the Old Testament, as is appointed.
And after that_ Magnificat (_or the Song of the Blessed Virgin
Mary_) _in English, as followeth_.

MAGNIFICAT.

St Luke i.

My soul doth magnify the Lord: and my spirit hath rejoiced in God
my Saviour.

For he hath regarded: the lowliness of his hand-maiden.

For behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed.

For he that is mighty hath magnified me: and holy is his Name.

And his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations.

He hath shewed strength with his arm: he hath scattered the proud
in the imagination of their hearts.

He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the
humble and meek.

He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath
sent empty away.

He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel: as he
promised to our forefathers  Abraham and his seed for ever.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Or else this Psalm: Except it be on the nineteenth day of the
month, when it is read in the ordinary course of the Psalms_.

CANTATE DOMINO.

Psalm xcviii.

O sing unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.

With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten
himself the victory.

The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly
shewed in the sight of the heathen.

He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel:
and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.

Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice,
and give thanks.

Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of
thanksgiving.

With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before
the Lord the King.

Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round
world, and they that dwell therein.

Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful
together before the Lord: for he cometh to judge the earth.

With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with
equity.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

after that_ Nunc dimittis (_or the Song of Simeon_) _in English,
as followeth_.

NUNC DIMITTIS.

St Luke ii. 29.

Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace: according to
thy word.

For mine eyes have seen: thy salvation;

Which thou hast prepared: before the face of all people;

To be a light to lighten the Gentiles: and to be the glory of
thy people Israel.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Or else this Psalm: Except it be on the twelfth day of the month_.

DEUS MISEREATUR.

Psalm lxvii.

God be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of
his countenance, and be merciful unto us:

That thy way may be known upon earth; thy saving health among all
nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise
thee.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the
folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise
thee.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our
own God, shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Then shall be said or sung the Apostles Creed, by the Minister
and the people standing_.

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was conceived by
the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius
Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell;
The third day he rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven,
And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; From
thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Catholic Church; The
Communion of Saints; The Forgiveness of sins; The Resurrection
of the body, And the life everlasting. Amen.

_Answer_. And with thy spirit.

_Minister_. Let us pray.

Prayer with a loud voice_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

AT MORNING PRAYER


_Upon these Feasts_; Christmas-day, _the_ Epiphany, _Saint_
Matthias, Easter-day, Ascension-day, Whitsunday, _Saint_ John
Baptist, _Saint_ James, _Saint_ Bartholomew, _Saint_ Matthew,
_Saint_ Simon _and Saint_ Jude, _Saint_ Andrew, _and upon_ Trinity
Sunday, _shall be sung or said at Morning Prayer, instead of the
Apostles Creed, this Confession of our Christian Faith, commonly
called the Creed of Saint Athanasius, by the Minister and people
standing_.

QUICUNQUE VULT.

Whosoever will be saved: before all things it is necessary that
he hold the Catholic Faith.

Which Faith, except every one do keep whole and undefiled:
without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

And the Catholic Faith is this: That we worship one God in
Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;

Neither confounding the Persons: nor dividing the Substance.

For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son: and
another of the Holy Ghost.

But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
is all one: the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.

Such as the Father is, such is the Son: and such is the Holy Ghost.

The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate: and the Holy Ghost uncreate.

The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible: and the
Holy Ghost incomprehensible.

The Father eternal, the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal.

And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.

As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated:
but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.

So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty: and the
Holy Ghost Almighty.

And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.

So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God.

And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.

So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghost
Lord.

And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.

For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge
every Person by himself to be God and Lord;

So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion: to say there be three
Gods, or three Lords.

The Father is made of none: neither created, nor begotten.

The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten.

The Holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son: neither made, nor
created, nor begotten, but proceeding.

So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons:
one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.

And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater,
or less than another;

But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together: and co-equal.

So that in all things, as is aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and
the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.

He therefore that will be saved: must thus think of the Trinity.

Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation: that he also
believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

For the right Faith is that we believe and confess: that our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;

God of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and
Man of the Substance of his Mother, born in the world;

Perfect God, and perfect Man: of a reasonable soul and human flesh
subsisting;

Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead: and inferior to the
Father, as touching his Manhood.

Who although he be God and Man: yet he is not two, but one Christ;

One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh: but by taking of
the Manhood into God;

One altogether, not by confusion of Substance: but by unity of
Person.

For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and Man is
one Christ.

Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hell, rose again the
third day from the dead.

He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the
Father, God Almighty: from whence he shall come to judge the quick
and the dead.

At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies: and
shall give account for their own works.

And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and
they that have done evil into everlasting fire.

This is the Catholic Faith: which except a man believe faithfully
he cannot be saved.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.




THE LITANY


_Here followeth the Litany, or General Supplication, to be sung or
said after Morning Prayer, upon Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

contempt of thy Word and Commandment,

By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and
Circumcision; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

By thine Agony and bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy
precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and
Ascension; and by the coming of the Holy Ghost,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our wealth; in
the hour of death, and in the day of judgement,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

promise that when two or three are gathered together in thy

desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient
for them; granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and
in the world to come life everlasting. _Amen_.

PRAYERS AND THANKSGIVINGS

_Upon several occasions, to be used before the final Prayers of the
Litany, or of Morning and Evening Prayer_.



PRAYERS

_For Rain_.

O God, heavenly Father, who by thy Son Jesus Christ hast promised
to all them that seek thy kingdom, and the righteousness thereof,
all things necessary to their bodily sustenance: Send us, we
beseech thee, in this our necessity, such moderate rain and
showers, that we may receive the fruits of the earth to our
comfort, and to thy honour; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_For fair Weather_.

O almighty Lord God, who for the sin of man didst once drown all
the world, except eight persons, and afterward of thy great mercy
didst promise never to destroy it so again: We humbly beseech thee,
that although we for our iniquities have worthily deserved a plague
of rain and waters, yet upon our true repentance thou wilt send us
such weather, as that we may receive the fruits of the earth in due
season; and learn both by thy punishment to amend our lives, and
for thy clemency to give thee praise and glory; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_In the time of Dearth and Famine_.

O God, heavenly Father, whose gift it is that the rain doth fall,
the earth is fruitful, beasts increase, and fishes do multiply:
Behold, we beseech thee, the afflictions of thy people; and grant
that the scarcity and dearth, which we do now most justly suffer
for our iniquity, may through thy goodness be mercifully turned
into cheapness and plenty; for the love of Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, now
and for ever. _Amen_.

_Or this_.

O God, merciful Father, who, in the time of Elisha the prophet,
didst suddenly in Samaria turn great scarcity and dearth into
plenty and cheapness: Have mercy upon us, that we, who are now
for our sins punished with like adversity, may likewise find a
seasonable relief: Increase the fruits of the earth by thy
heavenly benediction; and grant that we, receiving thy bountiful
liberality, may use the same to thy glory, the relief of those
that are needy, and our own comfort; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

_In the time of War and Tumults_.

O almighty God, King of all kings, and Governor of all things,
whose power no creature is able to resist, to whom it belongeth
justly to punish sinners, and to be merciful to them that truly
repent: Save and deliver us, we humbly beseech thee, from the
hands of our enemies; abate their pride, assuage their malice,
and confound their devices; that we, being armed with thy defence,
may be preserved evermore from all perils, to glorify thee, who
art the only giver of all victory; through the merits of thy only
Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_In the time of any common Plague or Sickness_.

O almighty God, who in thy wrath didst send a plague upon thine
own people in the wilderness, for their obstinate rebellion
against Moses and Aaron; and also, in the time of king David,
didst slay with the plague of pestilence threescore and ten
thousand, and yet remembering thy mercy didst save the rest:
Have pity upon us miserable sinners, who now are visited with
great sickness and mortality; that like as thou didst then accept
of an atonement, and didst command the destroying Angel to cease
from punishing, so it may now please thee to withdraw from us
this plague and grievous sickness; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

_In the Ember Weeks, to be said every day, for those that are to
be admitted into Holy Orders_.

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who hast purchased to thyself
an universal Church by the precious blood of thy dear Son:
Mercifully look upon the same, and at this time so guide and
govern the minds of thy servants the Bishops and Pastors of thy
flock, that they may lay hands suddenly on no man, but faithfully
and wisely make choice of fit persons to serve in the sacred
Ministry of thy Church. And to those which shall be ordained to
any holy function give thy grace and heavenly benediction; that
both by their life and doctrine they may set forth thy glory, and
set forward the salvation of all men; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

_Or this_.

Almighty God, the giver of all good gifts, who of thy divine
providence hast appointed divers Orders in thy Church: Give thy
grace, we humbly beseech thee, to all those who are to be called
to any office and administration in the same; and so replenish
them with the truth of thy doctrine, and endue them with innocency
of life, that they may faithfully serve before thee, to the glory
of thy great Name, and the benefit of thy holy Church; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_A Prayer that may be said after any of the former_.

O God, whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to
forgive, receive our humble petitions; and though we be tied
and bound with the chain of our sins, yet let the pitifulness
of thy great mercy loose us; for the honour of Jesus Christ, our
Mediator and Advocate. _Amen_.

_A Prayer for the High Court of Parliament, to be read during
their Session_.

Most gracious God, we humbly beseech thee, as for this Kingdom
in general, so especially for the High Court of Parliament, under
our most religious and gracious King at this time assembled: That
thou wouldest be pleased to direct and prosper all their
consultations to the advancement of thy glory, the good of thy
Church, the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and his
Dominions; that all things may be so ordered and settled by their
endeavours, upon the best and surest foundations, that peace
and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety, may be
established among us for all generations. These and all other
necessaries, for them, for us, and thy whole Church, we humbly
beg in the Name and Mediation of Jesus Christ our most blessed
Lord and Saviour. _Amen_.

_A Collect or Prayer for all Conditions of men, to be used at
such times when the Litany is not appointed to be said_.

O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly
beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men; that thou
wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving
health unto all nations. More especially we pray for the good
estate of the Catholic Church; that it may be so guided and
governed by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call
themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and
hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and
in righteousness of life. Finally we commend to thy fatherly
goodness all those, who are any ways afflicted or distressed
in mind, body, or estate; [_especially * those for whom our
prayers are desired;_] that it may please thee to comfort and
relieve them, according to their several necessities giving them
patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all
their afflictions. And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake.
_Amen_.

the Congregation.

THANKSGIVINGS

A General Thanksgiving.

Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants
do give thee most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness
and loving-kindness to us and to all men; [ * _particularly to
those who desire now to offer up their praises and thanksgivings
for thy late mercies vouchsafed unto them._] We bless thee for
our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life;
but above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of
the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, for the means of grace, and
for the hope of glory. And we beseech thee, give us that due sense
of all thy mercies, that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful,
and that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in
our lives; by giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking
before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days; through
Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all
honour and glory, world without end. _Amen_.

[Margin Note:] * This to be said when any that have been prayed
for desire to return praise.

_For Rain_.

O God our heavenly Father, who by thy gracious providence dost
cause the former and the latter rain to descend upon the earth,
that it may bring forth fruit for the use of man: We give thee
humble thanks that it hath pleased thee, in our great necessity,
to send us at the last a joyful rain upon thine inheritance, and
to refresh it when it was dry, to the great comfort of us thy
unworthy servants, and to the glory of thy holy Name; through thy
mercies in Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_For fair Weather_.

O Lord God, who hast justly humbled us by thy late plague of
immoderate rain and waters, and in thy mercy hast relieved and
comforted our souls by this seasonable and blessed change of
weather: We praise and glorify thy holy Name for this thy mercy,
and will always declare thy loving-kindness from generation to
generation; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_For Plenty_.

O most merciful Father, who of thy gracious goodness hast heard
the devout prayers of thy Church, and turned our dearth and
scarcity into cheapness and plenty: We give thee humble thanks

loving-kindness unto us, that our land may yield us her fruits of
increase, to thy glory and our comfort; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

_For Peace and Deliverance from our Enemies_.

O almighty God, who art a strong tower of defence unto thy servants
against the face of their enemies: We yield thee praise and
thanksgiving for our deliverance from those great and apparent

world may know that thou art our Saviour and mighty Deliverer;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_For restoring Public Peace at Home_.

one mind in a house, and stillest the outrage of a violent and
unruly people: We bless thy holy Name, that it hath pleased thee
to appease the seditious tumults which have been lately raised up
amongst us: most humbly beseeching thee to grant to all of us grace,
that we may henceforth obediently walk in thy holy commandments;
and leading a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and
honesty, may continually offer unto thee our sacrifice of praise
and thanksgiving for these thy mercies towards us; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_For Deliverance from the Plague, or other common Sickness_.

O Lord God, who hast wounded us for our sins, and consumed us for
our transgressions, by thy late heavy and dreadful visitation; and
now, in the midst of judgement remembering mercy, hast redeemed
our souls from the jaws of death: We offer unto thy fatherly
goodness ourselves, our souls and bodies which thou hast delivered,
to be a living sacrifice unto thee, always praising and magnifying
thy mercies in the midst of thy Church; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

_Or this_.

We humbly acknowledge before thee, O most merciful Father, that all
the punishments which are threatened in thy law might justly have
fallen upon us, by reason of our manifold transgressions and
hardness of heart: Yet seeing it hath pleased thee of thy tender
mercy, upon our weak and unworthy humiliation, to assuage the
contagious sickness wherewith we lately have been sore afflicted,
and to restore the voice of joy and health into our dwellings: We
offer unto thy Divine Majesty the sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving, lauding and magnifying thy glorious Name for such
thy preservation and providence over us; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

THE COLLECTS EPISTLES AND GOSPELS

TO BE USED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR


_Note that the Collect appointed for every Sunday, or for any
Holy-day that hath a Vigil or Eve, shall be said at the Evening
Service next before_.

| _Before the Collect of the day may be said_ Let us pray.



THE FIRST SUNDAY IN ADVENT

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of
darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time of
this mortal life, in which thy Son Jesus Christ came to visit us
in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again
in his glorious Majesty, to judge both the quick and the dead, we
may rise to the life immortal; through him who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the Holy Ghost, now and ever. _Amen_.

_This Collect is to be repeated every day with the other Collects
in Advent, until Christmas Eve_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. xiii. 8.

Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any
other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying,
namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no
ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out
of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast
off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
Let us walk honestly as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness,
not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But
put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the
flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxi. 1.

When they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage,
unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying
unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway
ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and
bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall
say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send
them. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the Prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass,
and a colt the foal of an ass. And the disciples went, and did as
Jesus commanded them; and brought the ass, and the colt, and put
on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great
multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches
from the trees, and strawed them in the way. And the multitudes
that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the
Son of David; Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord;
Hosanna in the Highest. And when he was come into Jerusalem all the
city was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This
is Jesus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into
the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in
the temple; and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and
the seats of them that sold doves; and said unto them, It is
written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have
made it a den of thieves.

THE SECOND SUNDAY IN ADVENT

THE COLLECT.

Blessed Lord, who hast caused all holy Scriptures to be written
for our learning: Grant that we may in such wise hear them,
read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience
and comfort of thy holy Word, we may embrace and ever hold fast
the blessed hope of everlasting life, which thou hast given us
in our Saviour Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. xv. 4.

Whatsoever things were written afore time were written for our
learning; that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures
might have hope. Now the God of patience and consolation grant
you to be like-minded one towards another, according to Christ
Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive ye one
another, as Christ also received us, to the glory of God. Now I
say, that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the
truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; and
that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles,
and sing unto thy Name. And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles,
with his people. And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and
laud him, all ye people. And again, Esaias saith, There shall be
a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles,
in him shall the Gentiles trust. Now the God of hope fill you with
all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope,
through the power of the Holy Ghost.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xxi. 25.

And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity,
the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear,
and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth:
for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see
the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And
when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift
up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. And he spake to
them a parable; Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they
now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is
now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to
pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I
say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be
fulfilled: heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall
not pass away.

THE THIRD SUNDAY IN ADVENT

THE COLLECT.

O Lord Jesu Christ, who at thy first coming didst send thy
messenger to prepare thy way before thee: Grant that the ministers
and stewards of thy mysteries may likewise so prepare and make
ready thy way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the
wisdom of the just, that at thy second coming to judge the world
we may be found an acceptable people in thy sight, who livest and
reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, ever one God, world
without end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. iv. 1.

Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is required in
stewards, that a man be found faithful. But with me it is a very
small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgement:
yea, I judge not mine own self. For I know nothing by myself, yet
am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and
will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall
every man have praise of God.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xi. 2.

Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent
two of his disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that should
come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto
them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and
see: the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have the Gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever
shall not be offended in me. And as they departed, Jesus began to
say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into
the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind? But what went
ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they
that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. But what went ye
out for to see? a prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a
prophet. For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT

THE COLLECT.

O Lord, raise up (we pray thee) thy power, and come among us, and
with great might succour us; that whereas, through our sins and
wickedness, we are sore let and hindered in running the race that
is set before us, thy bountiful grace and mercy may speedily help
and deliver us; through the satisfaction of thy Son our Lord, to
whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be honour and glory, world
without end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Philip, iv. 4.

Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say, Rejoice. Let your
moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful
for nothing: but in every thing, by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. And the
peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

THE GOSPEL. St John i. 19.

This is the record of John, when the Jews sent Priests and Levites
from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed, and
denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked
him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou
that Prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they unto him, Who
art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What
sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in
the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the
prophet Esaias. And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that Prophet? John
answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
one among you, whom ye know not: he it is who coming after me is
preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to
unloose. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where
John was baptizing.

THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD, OR THE BIRTH-DAY OF CHRIST,

COMMONLY CALLED

CHRISTMAS DAY

_December_ 25.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to take our
nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a pure Virgin:
Grant that we being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption
and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit; through the
same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and
the same Spirit, ever one God, world without end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Hebr. i. 1.

God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
by whom also he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his
glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all
things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our
sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being
made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the
angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall
be to me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten
into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship
him. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy
throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness
is the sceptre of thy kingdom: Thou hast loved righteousness, and
hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And, Thou, Lord, in
the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the
heavens are the works of thine hands: they shall perish, but thou
remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a
vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but
thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

THE GOSPEL. St John i. 1.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was
made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the
light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came
for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through
him might believe. He was not that light, but was sent to bear
witness of that light. That was the true light, which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and
the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came
unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on his Name: which were born, not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begottenof the Father)
full of grace and truth.

| _If there be two or more celebrations of the Holy Communion in_

|
| THE EPISTLE. Titus ii. 11.
|
| The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
| men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
| we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
| world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing
| of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself
| for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
| unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
|
| THE GOSPEL. St Luke ii. 1.
|
| It came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
| from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And
| this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
| And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And
| Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
| into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
| (because he was of the house and lineage of David,) to be taxed
| with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it
| was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
| that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn
| son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a
| manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there
| were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
| watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord
| came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them:
| and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear
| not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
| shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the
| city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this
| shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
| swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was
| with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God,
| and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
| good will toward men.
|
| _Or_ St Matth. i. 18.
|
| The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother
| Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was
| found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband,
| being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example,
| was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these
| things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
| dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto
| thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the
| Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call
| his name JESUS; for he shall save his people from their sins.
| (Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
| spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a Virgin
| shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they
| shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God
| with us.) Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel
| of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife; and knew
| her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he
| called his name JESUS.

SAINT STEPHEN'S DAY

_December_ 26.

THE COLLECT.

Grant, O Lord, that in all our sufferings here upon earth, for the
testimony of thy truth, we may stedfastly look up to heaven, and
by faith behold the glory that shall be revealed; and, being
filled with the Holy Ghost, may learn to love and bless our
persecutors, by the example of thy first Martyr Saint Stephen,
who prayed for his murderers to thee, O blessed Jesus, who
standest at the right hand of God to succour all those that
suffer for thee, our only Mediator and Advocate. _Amen_.

_Then shall follow the Collect of the Nativity, which shall be
said continually unto New-year's Eve_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts vii. 55.

Stephen, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right
hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the
Son of Man standing on the right hand of God. Then they cried
out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him
with one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him:
and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet,
whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God,
and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled down,
and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxiii. 34.

Behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and
some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall
ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to
city; that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon
the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of
Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and
the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come
upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest
the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee; how
often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen
gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold,
your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye
shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he
that cometh in the Name of the Lord.

SAINT JOHN THE EVANGELIST'S DAY

_December_ 27.

THE COLLECT.

Merciful Lord, we beseech thee to cast thy bright beams of light
upon thy Church, that it being enlightened by the doctrine of
thy blessed Apostle and Evangelist Saint John may so walk in the
light of thy truth, that it may at length attain to the light of
everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 St John i. 1.

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands
have handled of the word of life; (for the life was manifested,
and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that
eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto
us;) That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that
ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is
with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things
write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then is the
message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, That
God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that
we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and
do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the
light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that
we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

THE GOSPEL. St John xxi. 19.

Jesus said unto Peter, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth
the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on
his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth
thee? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this
man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee? Follow thou me. Then went this saying abroad
among the brethren, That that disciple should not die: yet Jesus
said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry
till I come, what is that to thee? This is the disciple which
testifieth of these things, and wrote these things, and we know
that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things
which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one,
I suppose, that even the world itself could not contain the books
that should be written.

THE INNOCENTS' DAY

_December_ 28.

O almighty God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast
ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their
deaths: Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us
by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy
of our faith, even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Rev. xiv. 1.

I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an
hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's Name written
in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice
of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard
the voice of harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as
it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts,
and the elders; and no man could learn that song, but the hundred
and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
These are they which were not defiled with women, for they are
virgins: these are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth: these were redeemed from among men, being the first-fruits
unto God, and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile;
for they are without fault before the throne of God. `1

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. ii. 13.

The Angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying,
Arise, and take the young child, and his mother, and flee into
Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word; for Herod will
seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the
young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, and
was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt
have I called my Son. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked
of the wise men, was exceeding wroth; and sent forth, and slew
all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts
thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which
he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that
which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there
a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel
weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because
they are not.

through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth

end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Gal. iv. 1.

Now I say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under
tutors and governors, until the time appointed of the father.
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
elements of the world: but when the fulness of the time was come,
God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to
redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth
the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir of God through Christ.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. i. 18.

The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother
Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband,
being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example,
was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these
things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a

thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call
his name JESUS; for he shall save his people from their sins.
(Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a Virgin shall
be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call
his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.) Then
Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had
bidden him, and took unto him his wife; and knew her not till she
had brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name JESUS.

THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST

_January_ 1.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who madest thy blessed Son to be circumcised, and
obedient to the law for man: Grant us the true circumcision of the
Spirit; that, our hearts, and all our members, being mortified
from all worldly and carnal lusts, we may in all things obey thy
blessed will; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. iv. 8.

Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Cometh
this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the
uncircumcision also? For we say, that faith was reckoned to
Abraham for righteousness. How was it then reckoned? when he was
in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but
in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of circumcision, a
seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that
believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might
be imputed unto them also: And the father of circumcision to them
who are not of the circumcision only, but also walk in the steps
of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet
uncircumcised. For the promise, that he should be the heir of
the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law,
but through the righteousness of faith. For if they which are of
the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none
effect.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke ii. 15.

And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into
heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even
unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which
the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and
found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when
they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told
them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at
those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept
all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds
returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they
had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. And when eight days
were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was
called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was
conceived in the womb.

|
| _Or_ 1 St John iv. 9.
|
| In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
| God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
| live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
| that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for
| our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love
| one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one
| another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
| Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
| hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify
| that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
| Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God

O God, who by the leading of a star didst manifest thy only-begotten

For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
Gentiles; if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God,
which is given me to you-ward: How that by revelation he made known
unto me the mystery (as I wrote afore in few words, whereby, when
ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it
is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit;
That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body,
and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel: whereof I
was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God
given unto me by the effectual working of his power. Unto me, who
am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I
should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who
created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent, that now unto
the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by
the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal
purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: In whom we
have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. ii. 1.

When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod
the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod
the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and
scribes of the people together, he demanded of them, where Christ
should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea:
for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou, Bethlehem, in the
land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out
of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule my people Israel.
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of
them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to
Bethlehem, and said, Go, and search diligently for the young child,
and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come
and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed;
and lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them, till
it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw
the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were
come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother,
and fell down and worshipped him: and when they had opened their
treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense,
and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not
return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of thy

Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. xii. 1.

I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to
this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,
that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect
will of God. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every
man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than
he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath
dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many
members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so
we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one
of another.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke ii. 41.

Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to
Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast. And when they had
fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried
behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both
hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him
were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they
saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why
hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought
thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought
me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And
they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. And he
went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto
them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And
Jesus increased in wisdom, and stature, and in favour with God and
man.

Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to
us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion
of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that
teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he
that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with
diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be
without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that
which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly
love, in honour preferring one another: not slothful in business;
fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient in
tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing to the
necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which
persecute you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do
rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind one
towards another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of
low estate.

And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the
mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called, and his
disciples, to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother
of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her,
Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,
do it. And there were set there six water-pots of stone, after the
manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the water-pots with
water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto
them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And
they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water
that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants
which drew the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the
bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth
set forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that
which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. This
beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. xii. 16.

Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for
evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be
possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he
thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals
of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil
with good.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. viii. 1.

When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
him. And behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth
his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And
immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus saith unto him,
See thou tell no man, but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest,
and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto
them. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto
him a centurion beseeching him, and saying, Lord, my servant
lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus
saith unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered
and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under
my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
say unto this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus
heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I
say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel.
And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,
and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the
kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast
out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth. And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way, and as thou
hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed
in the self-same hour.

O God, who knowest us to be set in the midst of so many and great

always stand upright: Grant to us such strength and protection,
as may support us in all dangers, and carry us through all
temptations; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. xiii. 1.

Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever
therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God: and
they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers
are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then
not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt
have praise of the same: for he is the minister of God to thee for
good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth
not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger
to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs
be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For
for this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers,
attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to
all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom
custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.

And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that
the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. And his
disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us, we
perish. And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there
was a great calm. But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man
is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! And when he was
come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there
met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs,
exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And
behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee,
Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before
the time? And there was a good way off from them an herd of many
swine, feeding. So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast
us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. And he said
unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the
herd of swine: and behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently
down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. And
they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and
told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the
devils. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and
when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
their coasts.

THE EPISTLE. Coloss. iii. 12.

Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also
do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the
bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts,
to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual
songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever
ye do, in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xiii. 24.

The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in
his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among
the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and
brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants
of the householder came, and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow
good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said
unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him,
Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay;
lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with
them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat
into my barn.

O God, whose blessed Son was manifested that he might destroy the
works of the devil, and make us the sons of God, and heirs of
eternal life: Grant us, we beseech thee, that, having this hope,
we may purify ourselves, even as he is pure; that, when he shall
appear again with power and great glory, we may be made like unto
him in his eternal and glorious kingdom; where with thee, O Father,
and thee, O Holy Ghost, he liveth and reigneth, ever one God,
world without end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 St John iii. 1.

Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth
us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of
God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as
he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
even as he is pure. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also
the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. And ye know that
he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him, neither known him. Little children, let no man deceive
you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is
righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil
sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxiv. 23.

When if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and
false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch
that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very elect.
Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore, if they shall say unto
you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: Behold, he is in
the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh
out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also
the coming of the Son of Man be. For wheresoever the carcase is,
there will the eagles be gathered together. Immediately after the
tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven,
and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall
appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all
the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And
he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they
shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end
of heaven to the other.

Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. And every man
that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things: now
they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into
subjection, lest that by any means, when I have preached to
others, I myself should be a castaway.

SEPTUAGESIMA SUNDAY

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xx. 1.

The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his
vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny
a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the
third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place, and
said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is
right I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out
about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the
eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and
saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto
him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also
into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning
from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired
about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when
the first came, they supposed that they should have received more;
and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had
received it, they murmured against the good-man of the house,
saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made
them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the
day. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine
is, and go thy way; I will give unto this last even as unto thee.
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine
eye evil, because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the
first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

THE EPISTLE. 2 Cor. xi. 19.

Ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. For ye
suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a
man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the
face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak:
howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold
also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers of Christ?
(I speak as a fool,) I am more: in labours more abundant; in
stripes above measure; in prisons more frequent; in deaths oft.
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one; thrice
was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned; thrice I suffered ship
wreck; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings
often; in perils of waters; in perils of robbers; in perils by
mine own countrymen; in perils by the heathen; in perils in the
city; in perils in the wilderness; in perils in the sea; in perils
among false brethren; in weariness and painfulness; in watchings
often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and
nakedness; besides those things that are without, that which
cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is weak,
and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? If I must
needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine
infirmities. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke viii. 4.

When much people were gathered together, and were come to him out
of every city, he spake by a parable: A sower went out to sow his
seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and it was
trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. And some fell
upon a rock, and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away,
because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the
thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. And other fell on good
ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred-fold. And when
he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear,
let him hear. And his disciples asked him, saying, What might
this parable be? And he said, Unto you it is given to know the
mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that
seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by
the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh
away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe, and
be saved. They on the rock are they which, when they hear, receive
the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which
fell among thorns are they which, when they have heard, go forth,
and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life,
and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are
they which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word,
keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

O Lord, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity are
nothing worth: Send thy Holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts that
most excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and of all
virtues, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before
thee: Grant this for thine only Son Jesus Christ's sake. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. xiii. 1.

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth
not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not
behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but
rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth:
but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there
be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it
shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I
understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became
a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass
darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall
I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope,
charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xviii. 31.

Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished. For he
shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and
spitefully entreated, and spitted on: and they shall scourge him,
and put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again. And
they understood none of these things: and his saying was hid from
them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. And it came
to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind
man sat by the way-side begging: and hearing the multitude pass
by, he asked what it meant. And they told him, that Jesus of
Nazareth passeth by. And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of
David, have mercy on me. And they which went before rebuked him,
that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more,
Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood, and commanded
him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked
him, saying, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he
said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him,
Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he
received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the
people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

Almighty and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast
made, and dost forgive the sins of all them that are penitent:
Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we worthily

of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Joel ii. 12.

Turn ye even to me, saith the Lord, with all your heart, and with
fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rend your heart,
and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is
gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
repenteth him of the evil. Who knoweth if he will return, and
repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meat-offering and
a drink-offering unto the Lord your God? Blow the trumpet in Zion,
sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the people,
sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the
children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go
forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet; let the
priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and
the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give
not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over
them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their
God?

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. vi. 16.

When ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for
they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou
fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face, that thou appear
not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret; and
thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay
not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay
up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

THE FIRST SUNDAY IN LENT

THE COLLECT.

O Lord, who for our sake didst fast forty days and forty nights:
Give us grace to use such abstinence, that, our flesh being
subdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey thy godly motions in
righteousness and true holiness, to thy honour and glory, who
livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, one God,
world without end, _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 2 Cor. vi. 1.

We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also, that ye
receive not the grace of God in vain; (for he saith, I have heard
thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I
succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is
the day of salvation;) giving no offence in any thing, that the
ministry be not blamed; but in all things approving ourselves as
the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in
necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in
tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by
knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by
love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God; by
the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left;
by honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as
deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as
dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as
sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich;
as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. iv. 1.

Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be
tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty
nights, he was afterward an-hungred. And when the tempter came to
him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones
be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall
not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy
city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto
him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is
written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in
their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash
thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written
again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil
taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him
all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith
unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall
down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence,
Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and
behold, angels came and ministered unto him.

| When Jesus saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who seest that we have no power of ourselves to help
ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly in
our souls; that we may be defended from all adversities which may
happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault
and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Thess. iv. 1.

We beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that
as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and to please God,
so ye would abound more and more. For ye know what commandments
we gave you by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even
your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication;
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour; not in the lust of concupiscence, even
as the Gentiles which know not God; that no man go beyond and
defraud his brother in any matter; because that the Lord is the
avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
He therefore that despiseth despiseth not man, but God, who hath
also given unto us his Holy Spirit.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xv. 21.

Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon. And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son
of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he
answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought
him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. But he
answered and said, I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of
the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take
the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she said,
Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their
masters table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman,
great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her
daughter was made whole from that very hour.

THE THIRD SUNDAY IN LENT

THE COLLECT. We beseech thee, Almighty God, look upon the hearty
desires of thy humble servants, and stretch forth the right hand
of thy Majesty, to be our defence against all our enemies; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. v. 1.

Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in
love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for
us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling
savour. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness,
let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh saints; neither
filthiness, nor foolish-talking, nor jesting, which are not
convenient; but rather giving of thanks: for this ye know, that
no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of
God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
Be not ye therefore partakers with them: for ye were sometimes
darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of
light; (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and
righteousness, and truth;) proving what is acceptable unto the
Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but rather reprove them: for it is a shame even to speak of those
things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are
reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make
manifest is light. Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest,
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xi. 14.

Jesus was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to
pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people
wondered. But some of them said, He casteth out devils through
Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. And others, tempting him,
sought of him a sign from heaven. But he, knowing their thoughts,
said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought
to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth. If
Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
stand? because ye say, that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast
them out? therefore shall they be your judges. But if I with the
finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come
upon you. When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods
are in peace; but when a stronger than he shall come upon him,
and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he
trusted, and divideth his spoils. He that is not with me is
against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. When
the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry
places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return
unto my house whence I came out. And when he cometh, he findeth
it swept and garnished. Then goeth he and taketh to him seven
other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and
dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the
first. And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain
woman of the company lift up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
God, and keep it.

THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN LENT

THE COLLECT.

Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our evil
deeds do worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy
grace may mercifully be relieved; through our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Gal. iv. 21.

Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bond-maid, the other by a free-woman. But he who was of the
bond-woman was born after the flesh; but he of the free-woman
was by promise. Which things are an allegory: for these are the
two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to
bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia,
and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with
her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free; which is the
mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that
bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for
the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an
husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of
promise. But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted
him that was born after the Spirit; even so it is now. Nevertheless,
what saith the Scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for
the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the
free-woman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the
bond-woman, but of the free.

THE GOSPEL. St John vi. 1.

Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
which he did on them that were diseased. And Jesus went up into
a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. And the Passover,
a feast of the Jews, was nigh. When Jesus then lift up his eyes,
and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence
shall we buy bread, that these may eat? (And this he said to prove
him; for he himself knew what he would do.) Philip answered him,
Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that
every one of them may take a little. One of his disciples, Andrew,
Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, There is a lad here, which
hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they
among so many? And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there
was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about
five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given
thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to
them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes, as much as
they would. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples,
Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained
over and above unto them that had eaten. Then those men, when
they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth
that Prophet that should come into the world.

We beseech thee, Almighty God, mercifully to look upon thy people;

THE EPISTLE. Hebr. ix. 11.

Christ being come an High Priest of good things to come, by a
greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands; that is
to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and
calves; but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy
place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood
of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the
unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more
shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered
himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works
to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the Mediator of
the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of
the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which
are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

THE GOSPEL. St John viii. 46.

Jesus said, Which of you convinceth me of sin? and if I say the
truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God's
words; ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. Then
answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well, that thou
art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a
devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. And I seek
not mine own glory; there is one that seeketh and judgeth. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never
see death. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast
a devil: Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a
man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. Art thou greater
than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead:
whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my
honour is nothing; it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye
say, that he is your God: yet ye have not known him; but I know
him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like
unto you; but I know him, and keep his saying. Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad. Then said the
Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou
seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Before Abraham was, I am. Then took they up stones to cast
at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.

THE SUNDAY NEXT BEFORE EASTER

THE COLLECT.

Almighty and everlasting God, who, of thy tender love towards
mankind, hast sent thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, to take upon
him our flesh, and to suffer death upon the cross, that all mankind
should follow the example of his great humility: Mercifully grant,
that we may both follow the example of his patience, and also be
made partakers of his resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Philip, ii. 5.

Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who,
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God; but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him
the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and
being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God
also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above
every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
the glory of God the Father.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxvii. 1.

When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
the people took counsel against Jesus, to put him to death. And
when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to
Pontius Pilate the governor. Then Judas who had betrayed him, when
he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again
the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying, I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.
And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast
down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went
and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces,
and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury,
because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought
with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that
field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. (Then was
fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that
was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value, and gave
them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.) And Jesus
stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, Art
thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
answered nothing. Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not
how many things they witness against thee? And he answered him to
never a word, insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. Now at
that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a
prisoner, whom they would. And they had then a notable prisoner,
called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate
said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or
Jesus which is called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had
delivered him. When he was set down on the judgement-seat, his wife
sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man:
for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they
should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The governor answered and
said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto
you? They said, Barabbas. Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do
then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let
him be crucified. And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he
done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person:
see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be
on us, and on our children. Then released he Barabbas unto them:
and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall,
and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. And they stripped
him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a
crown of thorns they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right
hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying,
Hail, King of the Jews. And they spit upon him, and took the reed,
and smote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him they
took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and
led him away to crucify him. And as they came out they found a
man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to bear his
cross. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that
is to say, a place of a skull, they gave him vinegar to drink
mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not
drink. And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting
lots: that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet,
They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they
cast lots. And sitting down they watched him there; and set up
over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF
THE JEWS. Then were there two thieves crucified with him; one on
the right hand, and another on the left. And they that passed by
reviled him, wagging their heads, and saying, Thou that destroyest
the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou
be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Likewise also the
chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He
saved others, himself he cannot save: if he be the King of Israel,
let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He
trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he
said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which were crucified
with him, cast the same in his teeth. Now from the sixth hour there
was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the
ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, _Eli, Eli, lama
sabachthani?_ that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me? Some of them that stood there, when they heard that,
said, This man calleth for Elias. And straightway one of them ran,
and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him to drink. The rest said, Let be, let us see
whether Elias will come to save him. Jesus, when he had cried
again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And behold, the
vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,
and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were
opened, and many bodies of saints which slept arose, and came out
of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city,
and appeared unto many. Now when the centurion and they that were
with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake and those things
that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the
Son of God.

MONDAY BEFORE EASTER

FOR THE EPISTLE. Isaiah lxiii. 1.

Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?
this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness
of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
him that treadeth in the wine-fat? I have trodden the wine-press
alone, and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread
them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood
shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my
raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year
of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help;
and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own
arm brought salvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me. And I
will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in
my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. I will
mention the loving-kindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the
Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the
great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed
on them, according to his mercies, and according to the multitude
of his loving-kindnesses. For he said, Surely they are my people,
children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour. In all their
affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved
them: in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and he bare
them, and carried them all the days of old. But they rebelled,
and vexed his Holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their
enemy, and he fought against them. Then he remembered the days of
old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them
up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he
that put his Holy Spirit within him? that led them by the right
hand of Moses, with his glorious arm, dividing the water before
them, to make himself an everlasting name? that led them through
the deep as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not
stumble? As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of
the Lord caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to
make thyself a glorious name. Look down from heaven, and behold
from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory; where is
thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels, and of thy
mercies towards me? Are they restrained? Doubtless thou art our
Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge
us not: Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer, thy name is
from everlasting. O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy
ways? and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy
servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. The people of
thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries
have trodden down thy sanctuary. We are thine: thou never barest
rule over them; they were not called by thy name.

THE GOSPEL. St Mark xiv. 1.

After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might
take him by craft, and put him to death. But they said, Not on the
feast-day, lest there be an uproar of the people. And being in
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there
came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard, very
precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. And
there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said,
Why was this waste of the ointment made? for it might have been sold
for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor:
and they murmured against her. And Jesus said, Let her alone; why
trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me: for ye have the
poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good;
but me ye have not always. She hath done what she could; she is
come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. Verily I say unto
you, Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole
world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a
memorial of her. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto
the chief priests to betray him unto them. And when they heard it
they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how
he might conveniently betray him. And the first day of unleavened
bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him,
Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the
passover? And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing
a pitcher of water; follow him: and wheresoever he shall go in, say
ye to the good-man of the house, The Master saith, Where is the
guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
And he will shew you a large upper-room furnished and prepared:
there make ready for us. And his disciples went forth, and came
into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made
ready the passover. And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
And as they sat, and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. And they began to
be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another
said, Is it I? And he answered and said unto them, It is one of
the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish. The Son of Man indeed
goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son
of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man if he had never been
born. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to
them: and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my
blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. Verily I say
unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that
day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God. And when they had
sung an hymn they went out into the mount of Olives. And Jesus
saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night:
for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall
be scattered. But, after that I am risen, I will go before you
into Galilee. But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be
offended, yet will not I. And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say
unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow
twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. But he spake the more vehemently,
If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise.
Likewise also said they all. And they came to a place which was
named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here,
while I shall pray. And he taketh with him Peter and James and
John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy, and saith
unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death; tarry ye
here, and watch. And he went forward a little, and fell on the
ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass
from him. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto
thee; take away this cup from me; nevertheless, not what I will,
but what thou wilt. And he cometh and findeth them sleeping, and
saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch
one hour? Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation: the
spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. And again he went
away, and prayed, and spake the same words. And when he returned
he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither
wist they what to answer him. And he cometh the third time, and
saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough,
the hour is come; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands
of sinners. Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at
hand. And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of
the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. And he that
betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall
kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely. And as
soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him, and saith,
Master, master; and kissed him. And they laid their hands on him,
and took him. And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and
smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. And Jesus
answered, and said unto them, Are ye come out as against a thief,
with swords and with staves, to take me? I was daily with you in
the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the Scriptures must
be fulfilled. And they all forsook him, and fled. And there followed
him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked
body; and the young men laid hold on him: and he left the linen
cloth, and fled from them naked. And they led Jesus away to the
high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests
and the elders and the scribes. And Peter followed him afar off,
even into the palace of the high priest; and he sat with the
servants, and warmed himself at the fire. And the chief priests and
all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to
death; and found none. For many bare false witness against him,
but their witness agreed not together. And there arose certain,
and bare false witness against him, saying, We heard him say, I
will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three
days I will build another made without hands. But neither so did
their witness agree together. And the high priest stood up in the
midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it
which these witness against thee? But he held his peace, and
answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto
him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said,
I am; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest
rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned
him to be guilty of death. And some began to spit on him, and to
cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy:
and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. And
as Peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids
of the high priest; and when she saw Peter warming himself she
looked upon him, and said. And thou also wast with Jesus of
Nazareth. But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I
what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock
crew. And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that
stood by, This is one of them. And he denied it again. And a little
after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one
of them; for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth there
to. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this
man of whom ye speak. And the second time the cock crew. And Peter
called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock
crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought
thereon, he wept.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Isaiah l. 5.

Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither
turned away back. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to
them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
spitting. For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be
confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know
that I shall not be ashamed. He is near that justifieth me; who
will contend with me? Let us stand together; who is mine adversary?
let him come near to me. Behold, the Lord God will help me; who is
he that shall condemn me? Lo, they all shall wax old as a garment:
the moth shall eat them up. Who is among you that feareth the Lord,
that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and
hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon
his God. Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks
that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall
lie down in sorrow.

THE GOSPEL. St Mark xv. 1.

And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation
with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus,
and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate
asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said
unto him, Thou sayest it. And the chief priests accused him of
many things: but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again,
saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness
against thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing: so that Pilate
marvelled. Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
whomsoever they desired. And there was one named Barabbas, which
lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had
committed murder in the insurrection. And the multitude, crying
aloud, began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. But
Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the
King of the Jews? For he knew that the chief priests had delivered
him for envy. But the chief priests moved the people, that he should
rather release Barabbas unto them. And Pilate answered, and said
again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye
call the King of the Jews? And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they
cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. And so Pilate, willing
to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered
Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. And the soldiers
led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together
the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and platted a
crown of thorns, and put it about his head: and began to salute
him, Hail, King of the Jews. And they smote him on the head with a
reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. And
they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the
country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. And
they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted,
The place of a skull. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with
myrrh; but he received it not. And when they had crucified him they
parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should
take. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the
superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE
JEWS. And with him they crucify two thieves, the one on his right
hand, and the other on his left. And the scripture was fulfilled,
which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. And they
that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah,
thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
save thyself, and come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief
priests mocking said among themselves, with the scribes, He saved
others; himself he cannot save. Let Christ the King of Israel
descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they
that were crucified with him reviled him. And when the sixth hour
was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth
hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
_Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?_ which is, being interpreted, My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood
by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. And one ran
and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave
him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come
to take him down. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the
ghost. And the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
the bottom. And when the centurion, which stood over against him,
saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this
man was the Son of God.

THE EPISTLE. Hebr. ix. 16.

Where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of
the testator: for a testament is of force after men are dead; other
wise it is of no strength at all whilst the testator liveth.
Whereupon, neither the first testament was dedicated without
blood: for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people,
according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats,
with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book
and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament,
which God hath enjoined unto you. Moreover, he sprinkled with
blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. And
almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without
shedding of blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary that
the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with
these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices
than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made
with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven
itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; nor yet that
he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into
the holy place every year with blood of others: for then must he
often have suffered since the foundation of the world; but now once
in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die,
but after this the judgement: so Christ was once offered to bear
the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear
the second time without sin unto salvation.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xxii. 1.

Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
Passover. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might
kill him; for they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas
surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. And he went
his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he
might betray him unto them. And they were glad, and covenanted to
give him money. And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray
him unto them in the absence of the multitude. Then came the day of
unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. And he sent
Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may
eat. And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? And
he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there
shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into
the house where he entereth in. And ye shall say unto the good-man of
the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber,
where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he shall shew
you a large upper-room furnished; there make ready. And they went,
and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the
passover. And when the hour was come he sat down, and the twelve
Apostles with him. And he said unto them, With desire I have
desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say
unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled
in the Kingdom of God. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and
said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves. For I say unto
you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom
of God shall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake
it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body, which is given for
you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is
shed for you. But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with
me on the table. And truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined;
but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed. And they began to
inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this
thing. And there was also a strife among them, which of them should
be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the
Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that exercise
authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so:
but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and
he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he
that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at
meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye are they which have
continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a
kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and
drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold,
Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but
I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art
converted, strengthen thy brethren. And he said unto him, Lord,
I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death. And he
said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before
that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. And he said unto
them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked
ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Then said he unto them, But
now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip:
and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. For
I say unto you, That this that is written must yet be accomplished
in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things
concerning me have an end. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two
swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. And he came out, and
went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also
followed him. And when he was at the place, he said unto them,
Pray, that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn
from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down and prayed,
saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared
an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an
agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was as it were great
drops of blood falling-down to the ground. And when he rose up
from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping
for sorrow, and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest
ye enter into temptation. And while he yet spake, behold, a
multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went
before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said
unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss? When
they who were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him,
Lord, shall we smite with the sword? And one of them smote the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And Jesus
answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and
healed him. Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains
of the temple, and the elders who were come to him, Be ye come out
as against a thief, with swords and staves? When I was daily with
you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but
this is your hour, and the power of darkness. Then took they him,
and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house: and
Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the
midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among
them. But a certain maid beheld him, as he sat by the fire, and
earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. And after a
little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them.
And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about the space of one hour
after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this
fellow also was with him; for he is a Galilean. And Peter said,
Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet
spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter;
and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto
him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter
went out, and wept bitterly. And the men that held Jesus mocked
him, and smote him. And when they had blindfolded him, they
struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is
it that smote thee? And many other things blasphemously spake
they against him. And as soon as it was day, the elders of the
people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and
led him into their council, saying, Art thou the Christ? tell us.
And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: and if
I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. Hereafter
shall the Son of Man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto
them, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need we any further
witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

THURSDAY BEFORE EASTER

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. xi. 17.

In this that I declare unto you, I praise you not; that ye come
together not for the better, but for the worse. For first of all,
when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions
among you, and I partly believe it. For there must be also heresies
among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among
you. When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not
to eat the Lord's supper: for in eating every one taketh before
other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the
church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to
you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. For I have
received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That
the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread;
and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat;
this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of
me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as
oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat
this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he
come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup
of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of
the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh
unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you,
and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be
judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren,
when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. And if any man
hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto
condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xxiii. 1.

The whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. And they
began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the
nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying, That he
himself is Christ a King. And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou
the King of the Jews? And he answered him, and said, Thou sayest
it. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I
find no fault in this man. And they were the more fierce, saying,
He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning
from Galilee to this place. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked
whether the man were a Galilaean. And as soon as he knew that he
belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who
himself was also at Jerusalem at that time. And when Herod saw
Jesus he was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see him of a
long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped
to have seen some miracle done by him. Then he questioned with him
in many words; but he answered him nothing. And the chief priests
and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. And Herod with his
men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a
gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. And the same day
Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before they were
at enmity between themselves. And Pilate, when he had called
together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, said unto
them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth
the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, have
found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse
him: No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and lo, nothing
worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him,
and release him. For of necessity he must release one unto them
at the feast. And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with
this man, and release unto us Barabbas: (who for a certain sedition
made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) Pilate
therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. But
they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. And he said unto
them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found
no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let
him go. And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he
might be crucified: and the voices of them and of the chief priests
prevailed. And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they
required. And he released unto them him that for sedition and
murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered
Jesus to their will. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon
one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they
laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. And there
followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also
bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus, turning unto them, said,
Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves,
and for your children. For behold, the days are coming, in the
which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that
never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they
begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover
us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be
done in the dry? And there were also two other, malefactors, led
with him to be put to death. And when they were come to the place
which is called Calvary, there they crucified him; and the
malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. And the people
stood beholding; and the rulers also with them derided him, saying,
He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen
of God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and
offering him vinegar, and saying, If thou be the King of the
Jews, save thyself. And a superscription also was written over
him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING
OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors, which were hanged, railed
on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. But the
other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly;
for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done
nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou
comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto
thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. And it was about
the sixth hour: and there was a darkness over all the earth until
the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the vail of the
temple was rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud
voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and
having said thus, he gave up the ghost. Now when the centurion
saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was
a righteous man. And all the people that came together to that
sight, beholding the things that were done, smote their breasts
and returned. And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed
him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

GOOD FRIDAY

THE COLLECTS.

Almighty God, we beseech thee graciously to behold this thy family,
for which our Lord Jesus Christ was contented to be betrayed, and
given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon
the cross, who now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy
Ghost, ever one God, world without end. _Amen_.

Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body of
the Church is governed and sanctified: Receive our supplications
and prayers, which we offer before thee for all estates of men in
thy holy Church, that every member of the same, in his vocation
and ministry, may truly and godly serve thee; through our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

O merciful God, who hast made all men, and hatest nothing that thou
hast made, nor wouldest the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should be converted and live: Have mercy upon all Jews, Turks,
Infidels, and Heretics, and take from them all ignorance, hardness
of heart, and contempt of thy word; and so fetch them home, blessed
Lord, to thy flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of
the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one shepherd,
Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the
Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Hebr. x. 1.

The law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very
image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which they
offered year by year continually, make the comers there unto
perfect: for then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience
of sins. But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made
of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls
and of goats should take away sins. Wherefore, when he cometh into
the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but
a body hast thou prepared me: in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for
sin thou hast had no pleasure: then said I, Lo, I come (in the
volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.
Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt-offerings
and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
therein, (which are offered by the law;) then said he, Lo, I come
to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may
establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified, through
the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every
priest standeth daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the
same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this man,
after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on
the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies
be made his foot-stool. For by one offering he hath perfected for
ever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a
witness to us: for after that he had said before, This is the
covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the
Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds
will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember
no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering
for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he
hath consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his
flesh; and having an High Priest over the house of God; let us draw
near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our
hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith
without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) and let us
consider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works; not
forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see
the day approaching.

THE GOSPEL. St John xix. 1.

Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. And the soldiers
platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put
on him a purple robe, and said, Hail, King of the Jews: and they
smote him with their hands. Pilate therefore went forth again, and
saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may
know that I find no fault in him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing
the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto
them, Behold the man! When the chief priests therefore and officers
saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate
saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault
in him. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he
ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. When Pilate
therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; and went
again into the judgement-hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art
thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Then saith Pilate unto him,
Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to
crucify thee, and have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou
couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given
thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath
the greater sin. And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him:
but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art
not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh
against Caesar. When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought
Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgement-seat, in a place that is
called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the
preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith
unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they cried out, Away with him,
away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify
your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified: and they
took Jesus, and led him away. And he, bearing his cross, went forth
into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the
Hebrew, Golgotha: where they crucified him, and two other with him,
on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. And Pilate wrote a
title, and put it on the cross; and the writing was, JESUS OF
NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew,
and Greek, and Latin. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to
Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the
King of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I have written, I have
written. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took
his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and
also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top
throughout. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend
it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture
might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,
and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the
soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother,
and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple
standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman,
behold thy son. Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother.
And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there
was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with
vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When
Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished:
and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. The Jews therefore,
because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain
upon the cross on the sabbath-day, (for that sabbath-day was an
high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and
that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers, and brake
the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with
him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
they brake not his legs. But one of the soldiers with a spear
pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. For these things
were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him
shall not be broken. And again another Scripture saith, They shall
look on him whom they pierced.

Grant, O Lord, that as we are baptized into the death of thy
blessed Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, so by continual mortifying
our corrupt affections we may be buried with him; and that,

resurrection; for his merits, who died, and was buried, and rose
again for us, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 St Peter iii. 17.

It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well-doing, than for evil-doing. For Christ also hath once
suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us
to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the
Spirit: by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in
prison; which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering
of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing;
wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. The like
figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us, (not the
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience towards God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: who
is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxvii. 57.

When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named
Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple. He went to Pilate,
and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be
delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a
clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had
hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of
the sepulchre, and departed. And there was Mary Magdalene, and
the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. Now the next
day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests
and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember
that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days
I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made
sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and
steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead:
so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto
them, Ye have a watch; go your way, make it as sure as you can. So
they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and
setting a watch.

If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection
on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and
your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life,
shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify
therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and
covetousness, which is idolatry: for which things' sake the wrath
of God cometh on the children of disobedience: in the which ye also
walked some time, when ye lived in them.

THE GOSPEL. St John xx. 1.

The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away
from the sepulchre. Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter,
and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them,
They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know
not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that
other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So they ran both
together; and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came
first to the sepulchre; and he, stooping down and looking in,
saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh
Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth
the linen clothes lie; and the napkin that was about his head, not
lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by
itself. Then went in also that other disciple which came first to
the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. For as yet they knew not
the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the
disciples went away again unto their own home.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts x. 34.

Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth
him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word
which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by
Jesus Christ; (he is Lord of all;) that word, I say, ye know,
which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee,
after the baptism which John preached: how God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went about doing
good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God
was with him. And we are witnesses of all things which he did,
both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew,
and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and shewed
him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before
of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and
to testify that it is he who was ordained of God to be the Judge
of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that
through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission
of sins.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xxiv. 13.

Behold, two of his disciples went that same clay to a village
called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
And it came to pass, that while they communed together, and
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their
eyes were holden, that they should not know him. And he said unto
them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to
another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name
was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in
Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass
there in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And they
said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet
mighty in deed and word, before God and all the people: and how
the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to
death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he
which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to-day is
the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women
also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the
sepulchre; and when they found not his body, they came, saying that
they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
and found it even so as the women had said; but him they saw not.
Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all
that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered
these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses,
and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures
the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village
whither they went; and he made as though he would have gone
further: but they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it
is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to
tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them,
he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And
their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of
their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn
within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened
to us the Scriptures? And they rose up the same hour, and returned
to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, arid them
that were with them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath
appeared to Simon. And they told what things were done in the way,
and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts xiii. 26.

Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever
among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read
every sabbath-day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all
that w r as written of him, they took him down from the tree, and
laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead: and he
was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to
Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare
unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto
the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children,
in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in
the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more
to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the
sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm,
Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. For David,
after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on
sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: but he
whom God raised again saw no corruption. Be it known unto you there
fore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you
the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified
from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of
Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken
of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:
for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise
believe, though a man declare it unto you.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xxiv. 36.

Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them,
Peace be unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and
supposed that they had seen a spirit. And he said unto them, Why
are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold
my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for
a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he
had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. And while
they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them,
Have ye here any meat? And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish,
and of an honey comb. And he took it, and did eat before them. And
he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you,
while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which
were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the
psalms concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they
might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is
written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from
the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things.

thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 St John v. 4.

Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
victory that over cometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that
overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son
of God? This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
not by water only, but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit
that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are
three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear
witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and
these three agree in one. If we receive the witness of men, the
witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which
he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God
hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made
him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of
his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
life; and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life;
and he that hath not the Son hath not life.

The same day at evening, being the first day I of the week, when
the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto
them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto
them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when
they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto
you: As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he
had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive
ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted

This is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be
buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when
ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently; this is
acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: because
Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should
follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his
mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he
suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that
judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his own
body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto
righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as
sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and
Bishop of your souls.

THE GOSPEL. St John x. 11.

Jesus said, I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his
life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the
shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and
leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and
scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an
hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd,
and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me,
even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I
must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one
fold, and one shepherd.

that are contrary to their profession, and follow all such things
as are agreeable to the same; through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your
conversation honest among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak
against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they
shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submit
yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether
it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that
are sent by him, for the punishment of evildoers, and for the
praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that with
well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as
free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness; but
as the servants of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear
God. Honour the king.

THE GOSPEL. St John xvi. 16.

Jesus said to his disciples, A little while and ye shall not see
me; and again a little while and ye shall see me; because I go to
the Father. Then said some of his disciples among themselves,
What is this that he saith unto us, A little while and ye shall
not see me; and again a little while and ye shall see me; and,
Because I go to the Father? They said therefore, What is this that
he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. Now Jesus
knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do
ye inquire among your selves of that I said, A little while and
ye shall not see me; and again a little while and ye shall see
me? Verily, verily I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament,
but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman, when she is in travail,
hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is
delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish,
for joy that a man is born into the world. And ye now therefore
have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall
rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

O almighty God, who alone canst order the unruly wills and
affections of sinful men: Grant unto thy people, that they may
love the thing which thou commandest, and desire that which thou
dost promise; that so, among the sundry and manifold changes of
the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed, where true joys
are to be found; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. St James i. 17.

Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the
word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his
creatures. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift
to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man worketh
not the righteousness of God. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness
and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the
engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.

THE GOSPEL. St John xvi. 5.

Jesus said unto his disciples, Now I go my way to him that sent me,
and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But, because I have
said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that
I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto
you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come,
he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of
judgement: of sin, because they believe not on me; of righteousness,
because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; of judgement,
because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things
to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he, the
Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he
shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that
shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall
glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto
you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I,
that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

THE FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER EASTER

THE COLLECT.

O Lord, from whom all good things do come: Grant to us thy humble
servants, that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things
that be good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same;
through our Lord Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. St James i. 22.

Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer,
he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass. For
he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth
what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law
of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful
hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his
deed. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is
vain. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and
to keep himself unspotted from the world.

THE GOSPEL. St John xvi. 23.

Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye V shall ask the
Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked
nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may
be full. These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: the
time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but
I shall shew you plainly of the Father. At that day ye shall ask
in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father
for you; for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved
me, and have believed that I came out from God. I came forth from
the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world,
and go to the Father. His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest
thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that thou
knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee:
by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God. Jesus
answered them, Do ye now believe? Behold, the hour cometh, yea,
is now come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own,
and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the
Father is with me. These things I have spoken unto you, that in
me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation;
but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

THE ASCENSION DAY

THE COLLECT.

Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that like as we do believe
thy only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended into
the heavens; so we may also in heart and mind thither ascend, and
with him continually dwell, who liveth and reigneth with thee and
the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts i. 1.

The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
began both to do and teach, until the day in which he was taken
up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments
unto the Apostles whom he had chosen: to whom also he shewed
himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs; being
seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to
the kingdom of God: and, being assembled together with them,
commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but
wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard
of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be
baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. When they
therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord,
wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And
he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the
seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall
receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye
shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea,
and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And when
he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up,
and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they
looked stedfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men
stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of
Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus,
which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

THE GOSPEL. St Mark xvi. 14.

Jesus appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided
them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. And he
said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel
to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs
shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out
devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up
serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up
into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. And they went
forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and
confirming the word with signs following.

Christ is gone before, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the

THE EPISTLE. 1 St Peter iv. 7.

The end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore I sober, and
watch unto prayer. And above all things have fervent charity among
yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. Use
hospitality one to another without grudging. As every man hath
received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as
good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let
him speak as the oracles of God: if any man minister, let him do it
as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be
glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for
ever and ever. Amen.

THE GOSPEL. St John xv. 26, and part of Chapter xvi.

When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
he shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because
ye have been with me from the beginning. These things have I spoken
unto you, that ye should not be offended. They shall put you out
of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth
you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will
they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
But these things have I told you, that, when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you of them.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts ii. 1.

When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven,
as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they
were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as
of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and they were all filled
with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem
Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this
was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded,
because that every man heard them speak in his own language. And
they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold,
are not all these which speak Galilaeans? And how hear we every man
in our own tongue wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and
Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and
Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt,
and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews
and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our
tongues the wonderful works of God.

THE GOSPEL. St John xiv. 15.

Jesus said unto his disciples, If ye love me, keep my commandments.
And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom
the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth
him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. Yet a little
while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I
live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in
my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that hath my commandments,
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me
shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest
myself to him. Judas saith unto him, (not Iscariot,) Lord, how is
it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep
my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,
and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my
sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's
which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet
present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and
bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go
away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice,
because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater
than I. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when
it is come to pass, ye might believe. Hereafter I will not talk
much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath
nothing in me. But that the world may know that I love the Father;
and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts x. 34.

Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth
him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word
which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by
Jesus Christ; (he is Lord of all;) that word, I say, ye know, which
was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after
the baptism which John preached: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went about doing good,
and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was
with him. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both
in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew, and
hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and shewed him
openly: not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before
of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and
to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge
of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that
through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission
of sins. While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on
all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision which
believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that
on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered
Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded
them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him
to tarry certain days.

THE GOSPEL. St John iii. 16.

God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world,
but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on
him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already;
because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son
of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light,
neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts viii. 14.

When the Apostles, which were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria
had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John;
who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
receive the Holy Ghost: (for as yet he was fallen upon none of
them; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then
laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

THE GOSPEL. St John x. 1.

Verily, verily I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is
a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the
shepherd of the sheep: to him the porter openeth; and the sheep
hear his voice, and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth
them out. And, when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before
them, and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice. And a
stranger will they not follow; but will flee from him; for they
know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake Jesus unto
them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake
unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again; Verily, verily I say
unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me
are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. I am the
door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in
and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not but for to steal,
and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life,
and that they might have it more abundantly.

After this I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven:
and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew
thee things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in
the Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat
on the throne: and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and
a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne,
in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four
and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders
sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads
crowns of gold: and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and
thunderings and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning
before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. And before
the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the
midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts
full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a
lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had
a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And
the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to
come. And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to
him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the four
and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and
worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns
before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive
glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and
for thy pleasure they are, and were created.

THE GOSPEL. St John iii. 1.

There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him,
Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man
can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily I say unto thee,
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which
is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee,
Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it
cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of
the Spirit. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these
things be? Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of
Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily I say unto
thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen;
and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things,
and ye believe not; how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly
things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came
down from heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven. And as
Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have eternal life.

Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God, and every
one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth
not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the
love of God towards us, because that God sent his only-begotten
Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love,
not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to
be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we
ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time.
If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is
perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in
us; because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen, and
do testify, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the
world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the
love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love
dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect,
that we may have boldness in the day of judgement; because as he
is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect
love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment: he that feareth
is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved
us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how
can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have
we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xvi. 19.

There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every day. And there was a certain
beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full of sores,
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich
man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. And it
came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels
into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried: and
in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham
afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the
tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy
life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And
besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:
so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot; neither
can they pass to us, that would come from thence. Then he said,
I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my
father's house: for I have five brethren; that he may testify
unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. Abraham
saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear
them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them
from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto him, If they
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.

Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we
have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.
He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth
his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal
life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because
he laid clown his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives
for the brethren. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his
brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from
him; how dwelleth the love of God in him? My little children, let
us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed, and in truth.
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater
than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart
condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. And whatsoever
we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments,
and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is
his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son
Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And
he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him:
and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he
hath given us.

A certain man made a great supper, and bade many; and sent his
servant at supper-time to say to them that were bidden, Come, for
all things are now ready. And they all with one consent began to
make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of
ground, and I must needs go and see it; I pray thee have me
excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and
I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused. And another said,
I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So that
servant came and shewed his lord these things. Then the master
of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into
the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor,
and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. And the servant said,
Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the high-ways and
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall
taste of my supper.

THE THIRD SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to hear us; and grant that
we, to whom thou hast given an hearty desire to pray, may by
thy mighty aid be defended and comforted in all dangers and
adversities; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 St Peter v. 5.

All of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility:
for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble
yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
exalt you in due time; casting all your care upon him, for he
careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the
devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may
devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
world. But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his
eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. To him be glory
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xv. 1.

Then drew near unto him all the publicans and I sinners for to
hear him. And the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, This
man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. And he spake this
parable unto them, saying, What man of you having an hundred
sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine
in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find
it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his
friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for
I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise
joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than
over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
diligently till she find it? And when she hath found it, she
calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice
with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. Likewise,
I say unto you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God
over one sinner that repenteth.

THE FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

O God, the protector of all that trust in thee, without whom
nothing is strong, nothing is holy: Increase and multiply upon
us thy mercy; that, thou being our ruler and guide, we may so
pass through things temporal, that we finally lose not the things
eternal: Grant this, O heavenly Father, for Jesus Christ's sake
our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. viii 18.

I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the
earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation
of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity,
not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in
hope: because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of
God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
in pain together until now. And not only they, but our selves
also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves
groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
redemption of our body.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke vi. 36.

Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge
not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be
condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: give, and it shall
be given unto you; good measure, pressed clown, and shaken together,
and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the
same measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you
again. And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the
blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? The disciple is
not above his master; but every one that is perfect shall be as
his master. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy
brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own
eye? Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me
pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out
first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see
clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

THE FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

Grant, O Lord, we beseech thee, that the course of this world may
be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church may
joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 St Peter iii. 8.

Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love
as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous; not rendering evil for
evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing
that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let
him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them
that do evil. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers
of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness
sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither
be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke v. 1.

It came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the
word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two ships
standing by the lake; but the fishermen were gone out of them,
and were washing their nets. And he entered into one of the ships,
which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a
little from the land: and he sat down, and taught the people
out of the ship. Now when he had left speaking, he said unto
Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a
draught. And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled
all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless, at thy word
I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they inclosed
a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake. And they beckoned
unto their partners which were in the other ship, that they should
come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so
that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at
Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken; and so was also James, and
John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And
Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not, from henceforth thou shalt catch
men. And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
all, and followed him.

THE SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

O God, who hast prepared for them that love thee such good things
as pass man's under standing: Pour into our hearts such love
toward thee, that we, loving thee above all things, may obtain
thy promises, which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. vi. 3.

Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by
baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the
likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with
him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we
should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now
if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
with him; knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth
no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he
died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto
God. Likewise reckon ye also your selves to be dead indeed unto
sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. v. 20.

Jesus said unto his disciples, Except your righteousness shall
exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. Ye have heard that
it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill: and whosoever
shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgement. But I say unto you,
that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be
in danger of the judgement: and whosoever shall say to his
brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever
shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire. Therefore
if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before
the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and
then come and offer thy gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly,
whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary
deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the
officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee,
Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the
uttermost farthing.

THE SEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

Lord of all power and might, who art the author and giver of all
good things: Graft in our hearts the love of thy name, increase
in us true religion, nourish us with all goodness, and of thy great
mercy keep us in the same; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. vi. 19.

I speak after the manner of men, because of  the infirmity of your
flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness,
and to iniquity, unto iniquity; even so now yield your members
servants to righteousness, unto holiness. For when ye were the
servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had
ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of
those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become
servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of
God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

THE GOSPEL. St Mark viii. 1.

In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing
to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with
me three days, and have nothing to eat: and if I send them away
fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way; for
divers of them came from far. And his disciples answered him,
From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the
wilderness? And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they
said, Seven. And he commanded the people to sit down on the
ground. And he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake,
and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set
them before the people. And they had a few small fishes; and he
blessed, and commanded to set them also before them. So they did
eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was
left seven baskets. And they that had eaten were about four
thousand. And he sent them away.

THE EIGHTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

O God, whose never-failing providence ordereth all things both
in heaven and earth: We humbly beseech thee to put away from us
all hurtful things, and to give us those things which be profitable
for us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. viii. 12.

Brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the
flesh: for if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye
through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption,
whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness
with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children,
then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be
that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. vii. 15.

Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their
fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even
so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every
tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not
every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which
is in heaven.

THE NINTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

Grant to us, Lord, we beseech thee, the spirit to think and do
always such things as be rightful; that we, who cannot do any thing
that is good without thee, may by thee be enabled to live according
to thy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. x. 1.

Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all
our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the sea; and
did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same
spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed
them; and that rock was Christ. But with many of them God was not
well pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these
things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after
evil things, as they also lusted. Neither be ye idolaters, as were
some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and
drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication,
as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty
thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted,
and were destroyed of serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them
also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now all these
things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for
our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore
let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. There
hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man: but
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xvi. 1.

Jesus said unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man which
had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted
his goods. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I
hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
mayest be no longer steward. Then the steward said within himself,
What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship:
I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed. I am resolved what to do, that,
when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into
their houses. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto
him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take
thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then said he to
another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures
of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
And the lord com mended the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation
wiser than the children of light. And I say unto you, Make to
yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when
ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.

THE TENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy
humble servants; and that they may obtain their petitions make
them to ask such things as shall please thee; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. xii. 1.

Concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
ignorant. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these
dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand,
that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;
and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy
Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God,
who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is
given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the
Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by
the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another
the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working
of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits;
to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation
of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the self-same
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xix. 41.

And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,
the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from
thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies
shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground,
and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one
stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy
visitation. And he went into the temple, and began to cast out
them that sold therein, and them that bought, saying unto them,
It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made
it a den of thieves. And he taught daily in the temple.

THE ELEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

O God, who declarest thy almighty power most chiefly in shewing
mercy and pity: Mercifully grant unto us such a measure of thy
grace, that we, running the way of thy commandments, may obtain
thy gracious promises, and be made partakers of thy heavenly
treasure; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. xv. 1.

Brethren, I declare unto you the Gospel which I preached unto
you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand: by which
also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you,
unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first
of all, that which I also received, how that Christ died for our
sins, according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and
that he rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures; and
that he was seen of Cephas; then of the twelve: after that, he
was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the
greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep:
after that, he was seen of James; then of all the Apostles: and
last of all, he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
time. For I am the least of the Apostles, that am not meet to be
called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. But by
the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed
upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they
all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. Therefore
whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xviii. 9.

Jesus spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into
the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee
that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this publican: I fast twice in the week, I give tithes
of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would
not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his
breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this
man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for
every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted.

THE TWELFTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

Almighty and everlasting God, who art always more ready to hear
than we to pray, and art wont to give more than either we desire
or deserve: Pour down upon us the abundance of thy mercy; forgiving
us those things whereof our conscience is afraid, and giving us
those good things which we are not worthy to ask, but through the
merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 2 Cor. iii. 4.

Such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: not that we are
sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our
sufficiency is of God: who also hath made us able ministers of the
new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter
killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of
death written and engraven in stones was glorious, so that the
children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses
for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away;
how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For
if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the
ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

THE GOSPEL. St Mark vii. 31.

Jesus, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, came unto the
sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. And
they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his
speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. And he took
him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and
he spit, and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he
sighed, and saith unto him, _Ephphatha_, that is, Be opened. And
straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was
loosed, and he spake plain. And he charged them that they should
tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great
deal they published it; and were beyond measure astonished, saying,
He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and
the dumb to speak.

THE THIRTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY

THE COLLECT.

Almighty and merciful God, of whose only gift it cometh that thy
faithful people do unto thee true and laudable service: Grant, we
beseech thee, that we may so faithfully serve thee in this life,
that we fail not finally to attain thy heavenly promises; through
the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Gal. iii. 16.

To Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And
to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
Christ. And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed
before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and
thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the
promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is
no more of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise. Wherefore
then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions,
till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; and it
was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator
is not a mediator of one; but God is one. Is the law then against
the promises of God? God-forbid: for if there had been a law given
which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been
by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded  all under sin, that
the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
believe.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke x. 23.

Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see. For I tell
you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things
which ye see, and have not seen them: and to hear those things
which ye hear, and have not heard them. And behold, a certain
lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do
to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the
law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as
thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right; this do,
and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto
Jesus, And who is my neighbour? And Jesus answering said, A certain
man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves,
which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed,
leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain
Priest that way, and, when he saw him, he passed by on the other
side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain
Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and, when he saw
him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his
wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast,
and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow,
when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the
host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou
spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now
of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell
among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then
said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

Almighty and everlasting God, give unto us the increase of faith,
hope, and charity; and, that we may obtain that which thou dost

Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Gal. v. 16.

I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust
of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the
other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye
be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law. Now the works of
the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you
before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit
of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no
law. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with
the affections and lusts.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xvii. 11.

And it came to pass, as Jesus went to Jerusalem, that he passed
through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into
a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which
stood afar off: and they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus,
Master, have mercy on us. And when he saw them, he said unto them,
Go, shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass that,
as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified
God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks;
and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not
ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found that
returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said
unto him, Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.

things profitable to our salvation; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Gal. vi. 11.

Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
hand. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
persecution for the cross of Christ. For neither they themselves who
are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised,
that they may glory in your flesh. But God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the
world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Christ
Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision,
but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule,
peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. From
henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks
of the Lord Jesus. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. vi. 24.

No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. Therefore I say unto
you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye
shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not
the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the
fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor
gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye
not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add
one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment?
Consider the lilies of the field how they grow: they toil not,
neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if
God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow
is cast into the oven; shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of
little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?
or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For
after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly
Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye
first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these
things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the
morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself:
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

O Lord, we beseech thee, let thy continual pity cleanse and defend
thy Church; and, because it cannot continue in safety without thy
succour, preserve it evermore by thy help and goodness; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. iii. 13.

I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is
your glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth
is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his
glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner
man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all the fulness of God. Now unto him that
is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in
the Church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without
end. Amen.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke vii. 11.

And it came to pass the day after, that Jesus went into a city
called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much
people. Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold,
there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and
she was a widow; and much people of the city was with her. And
when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto
her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier; and they that
bare him stood still: and he said, Young man, I say unto thee,
Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak: and he
delivered him to his mother. And there came a fear on all, and
they glorified God, saying, that a great Prophet is risen up among
us, and that God hath visited his people. And this rumour of him
went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region
round about.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. iv. 1.

I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you, that ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness
and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;
endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you
all.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xiv. 1.

It came to pass, as Jesus went into the house of one of the chief
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath-day, that they watched him.
And behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
dropsy. And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,
saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath-day? And they held
their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; and
answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass, or an ox,
fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the
sabbath-day? And they could not answer him again to these things.
And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms, saying unto them, When
thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of
him; and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. But
when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that,
when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up
higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that
sit at meat with thee. For whosoever exalteth himself shall be
abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

Lord, we beseech thee, grant thy people grace to withstand the

THE EPISTLE. 1 Cor. i. 4.

I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is
given you by Jesus Christ; that in every thing ye are enriched by
him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony
of Christ was confirmed in you; so that ye come behind in no gift;
waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall also
confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxii. 34.

When the Pharisees had heard that Jesus had put the Sadducees to
silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them, who was
a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master,
which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great
commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law
and the prophets. While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus
asked them, saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They
say unto him, The son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth
David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord,
Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-stool?
If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able
to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask
him any more questions.

O God, forasmuch as without thee we are not able to please thee;
Mercifully grant, that thy Holy Spirit may in all things direct

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. iv. 17.

This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind;
having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life
of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
blindness of their heart: who, being past feeling, have given
themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with
greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; if so be that ye
have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in
Jesus: that ye put off, concerning the former conversation, the
old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be
renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
neighbour: for we are members one of another. Be ye angry and
sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give
place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more; but rather
let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt
communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good
to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are
sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath,
and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you,
with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted,
forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
you.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. ix. 1.

Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
city. And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the sick
of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.
And behold, certain of the Scribes said within themselves, This
man blasphemeth. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore
think ye evil in your hearts? For whether is easier, to say, Thy
sins be forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, and walk? But that ye
may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,
(then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed,
and go unto thine house. And he arose, and departed to his house.
But when the multitude saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
who had given such power unto men.

See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not
unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not
drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs;
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; giving thanks
always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ; submitting yourselves one to another in the
fear of God.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxii. 1.

Jesus said, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, who
made a marriage for his son; and sent forth his servants to call
them that were bidden to the wedding; and they would not come.
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings
are killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage. But
they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another
to his merchandise: and the remnant took his servants, and entreated
them spitefully, and slew them. But when the king heard thereof,
he was wroth; and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those
murderers, and burnt up their city. Then saith he to his servants,
The wedding is ready, but they who were bidden were not worthy. Go
ye therefore into the high-ways, and as many as ye shall find bid
to the marriage. So those servants went out into the high-ways, and
gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good;
and the wedding was furnished with guests. And when the king came
in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a
wedding-garment. And he saith unto him, Friend, how earnest thou
in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
take him away, and cast him into outer darkness: there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are
chosen.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. vi. 10.

My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God,
that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done
all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with
truth; and having on the breast-plate of righteousness; and your
feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; above all,
taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
all the fiery darts of the wicked: and take the helmet of salvation,
and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: praying
always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching
thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all saints;
and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my
mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel, for which I
am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I
ought to speak.

THE GOSPEL. St John iv. 46.

There was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When
he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went
unto him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his
son; for he was at the point of death. Then said Jesus unto him,
Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. The nobleman
saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. Jesus saith unto
him, Go thy way, thy son liveth. And the man believed the word
that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. And as he
was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying,
Thy son liveth. Then inquired he of them the hour when he began
to amend: and they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour
the fever left him. So the father knew that it was at the same
hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth; and himself
believed, and his whole house. This is again the second miracle
that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.

THE EPISTLE. Philip, i. 3.

I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every
prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, for your
fellowship in the Gospel from the first day until now; being
confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ; even
as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you
in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and
confirmation of the Gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. For
God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels
of Jesus Christ. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet
more and more in knowledge and in all judgement: that ye may
approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere, and
without offence, till the day of Christ: being filled with the
fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory
and praise of God.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xviii. 21.

Peter said unto Jesus, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I
say not unto thee, until seven times; but until seventy times
seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
king, which would take account of his servants. And when he had
begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten
thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord
commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that
he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down
and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I
will pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with
compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same
servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed
him an hundred pence; and he laid hands on him, and took him by the
throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his fellow-servant fell
down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me,
and I will pay thee all. And he would not; but went and cast him into
prison, till he should pay the debt. So when his fellow-servants
saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto
their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had
called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee
all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not thou also
have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on
thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
till he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall
my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts
forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

THE EPISTLE. Philip, iii. 17.

Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk
so as ye have us for an ensample. (For many walk, of whom I have
told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the
enemies of the cross of Christ; whose end is destruction, whose
god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind
earthly things.) For our conversation is in heaven; from whence
also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall
change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even
to subdue all things unto himself.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxii. 15.

Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle
him in his talk. And they sent out unto him their disciples, with
the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and
teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man:
for thou regardest not the person of men. Tell us therefore, what
thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me,
ye hypocrites? shew me the tribute-money. And they brought unto
him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
superscription? They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto
them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's;
and unto God the things that are God's. When they had heard these
words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.

We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints; for the
hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before
in the word of the truth of the Gospel; which is come unto you, as
it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also
in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in
truth. As ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow-servant,
who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; who also declared
unto us your love in the Spirit. For this cause we also, since the
day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that
ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
and spiritual understanding: that ye might walk worthy of the Lord
unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing
in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according
to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with
joyfulness; giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet
to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. ix. 18.

While Jesus spake these things unto John's disciples, behold,
there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter
is even now dead; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall
live. And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
(And behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood
twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:
for she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her,
he said, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee
whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.) And when
Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the
people making a noise, he said unto them, Give place; for the
maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by
the hand, and the maid arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into
all that land.

Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David

execute judgement and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall
be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name
whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. Therefore
behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say,
The Lord liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of
the land of Egypt; but, The Lord liveth, which brought up, and
which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north-country,
and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall
dwell in their own land.

THE GOSPEL. St John vi. 5.

When Jesus then lift up his eyes, and saw a great company come
unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that
these may eat? (And this he said to prove him; for he himself knew
what he would do.) Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of
bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a
little. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
unto him, There is a lad here, which hath five barley-loaves, and
two small fishes; but what are they among so many? And Jesus said,
Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So
the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus took
the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the
disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and
likewise of the fishes, as much as they would. When they were
filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that
remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them
together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five
barley-loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had
eaten. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus
did, said, This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into
the world.

| Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the

| is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the
| sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and
| leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he
| goeth before them, and the sheep follow him; for they know his
| voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from
| him; for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake
| Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were
| which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again,
| Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
| All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
| sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter
| in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
| The thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to
| destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they
| might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good

|
| _Or_ St John xxi. 15.
|
| Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
| me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
| that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith
| to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
| me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love
| thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the
| third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was
| grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou
| me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou
| knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
| Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
| girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when

| God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
| Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved

| Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing him saith

| If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
| Follow thou me.

SAINT ANDREW'S DAY

_November_ 30.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who didst give such grace unto thy holy Apostle
Saint Andrew, that he readily obeyed the calling of thy Son Jesus
Christ, and followed him without delay: Grant unto us all, that
we, being called by thy holy word, may forthwith give up ourselves
obediently to fulfil thy holy commandments; through the same Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Rom. x. 9.

If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,
thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto
righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation. For the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him
shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the
Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all
that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of
the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him, in
whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him,
of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a
preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? As it
is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they
have not all obeyed the Gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath
believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing
by the word of God. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily,
their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends
of the world. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I
will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by
a foolish nation I will anger you. But Esaias is very bold, and
saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest
unto them that asked not after me. But to Israel he saith, All
day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and
gainsaying people.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. iv. 18.

Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea,
(for they were fishers;) and he saith unto them, Follow me; and
I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their
nets, and followed him. And going on from thence he saw other two
brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a
ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called
them. And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
followed him.

SAINT THOMAS THE APOSTLE _December_ 21.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty and ever-living God, who for the more confirmation of
the faith didst suffer thy holy Apostle Thomas to be doubtful in
thy Son's resurrection: Grant us so perfectly, and without all
doubt, to believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, that our faith in thy
sight may never be reproved. Hear us, O Lord, through the same
Jesus Christ, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all
honour and glory, now and for evermore. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. ii. 19.

Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all
the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple
in the Lord; in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation
of God through the Spirit,

THE GOSPEL. St John xx. 24. Thomas, one of the twelve, called
Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples
therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said
unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust
my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days
again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came
Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,
Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy
finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and
thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord, and my God.
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence
of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these
are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

THE CONVERSION OF SAINT PAUL _January_ 25.

THE COLLECT.

O God, who, through the preaching of the blessed Apostle Saint
Paul, hast caused the light of the Gospel to shine throughout
the world: Grant, we beseech thee, that we, having his wonderful
conversion in remembrance, may shew forth our thankfulness unto
thee for the same, by following the holy doctrine which he taught;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts ix. 1.

And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired
of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found
any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring
them bound unto Jerusalem. And, as he journeyed, he came near
Damascus, and suddenly there shined round about him a light from
heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto
him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art
thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:
it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he, trembling
and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the
Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be
told thee what thou must do. And the men which journeyed with him
stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul
arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened he saw no man;
but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And
he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and
to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold,
I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of
Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth,
and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in, and
putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. Then
Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how
much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he
hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on
thy name. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way; for he is a
chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and
kings, and the children of Israel: for I will shew him how great
things he must suffer for my name's sake. And Ananias went his
way, and entered into the house; and, putting his hands on him,
said, Brother Saul, the Lord, (even Jesus that appeared unto
thee in the way as thou earnest,) hath sent me, that thou mightest
receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And
immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales; and
he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. And when
he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain
days with the disciples which were at Damascus. And straightway
he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
But all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that
destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came
hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the
chief priests? But Saul increased the more in strength, and
confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this
is very Christ.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xix. 27.

Peter answered and said unto Jesus, Behold, we have forsaken all,
and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said
unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me,
in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of
his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,
or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and
shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be
last, and the last shall be first.

THE PRESENTATION OF CHRIST IN THE TEMPLE,

COMMONLY CALLED THE PURIFICATION OF

SAINT MARY THE VIRGIN _February_ 2.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty and everliving God, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that,
as thy only-begotten Son was this day presented in the temple in
substance of our flesh, so we may be presented unto thee with
pure and clean hearts, by the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Mal. iii. 1.

Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his
temple; even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in;
behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide
the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for
he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers soap. And he shall
sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the
sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may
offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall the
offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in
the days of old, and as in former years. And I will come near to
you to judgement, and I will be a swift witness against the
sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers,
and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the
widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from
his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke ii. 22.

And when the days of her purification, according to the law of
Moses, were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
present him to the Lord; (as it is written in the law of the
Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to
the Lord;) and to offer a sacrifice, according to that which is
said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young
pigeons. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name
was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for
the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And
it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not
see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by
the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the
child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, then took
he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared
before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles,
and the glory of thy people Israel. And Joseph and his mother
marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. And Simeon
blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child
is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for
a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea, a sword shall pierce
through thy own soul also;) that the thoughts of many hearts may
be revealed. And there was one Anna a prophetess, the daughter of
Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age, and had
lived with an husband seven years from her virginity: and she was
a widow of about fourscore and four years; which departed not from
the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord,
and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in
Jerusalem. And when they had performed all things according to
the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city
Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled
with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.

SAINT MATTHIAS'S DAY _February_ 24.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who into the place of the traitor Judas didst choose
thy faithful servant Matthias to be of the number of the twelve
Apostles: Grant that thy Church, being alway preserved from false
Apostles, may be ordered and guided by faithful and true pastors;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts i. 15.

In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and
said, (the number of the names together were about an hundred
and twenty,) Men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have
been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus:
for he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
ministry. Now this man purchased a field with the reward of
iniquity; and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst,
and all his bowels gushed out. And it was known unto all the
dwellers at Jerusalem, insomuch as that field is called in their
proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For
it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
desolate, and let no man dwell therein; and, His bishopric let
another take. Wherefore, of these men which have companied with
us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he
was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with
us of his resurrection. And they appointed two, Joseph called
Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed,
and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew
whether of these two thou hast chosen; that he may take part of
this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression
fell, that he might go to his own place. And they gave forth their
lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with
the eleven Apostles.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xi. 25.

At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things
are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son,
but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son,
and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all
ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is
easy, and my burden is light.

THE ANNUNCIATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY _March_ 25.

THE COLLECT.

We beseech thee, O Lord, pour thy grace into our hearts; that, as
we have known the incarnation of thy Son Jesus Christ by the
message of an angel, so by his cross and passion we may be brought
unto the glory of his resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Isaiah vii. 10.

Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign
of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height
above. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the
Lord. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? Therefore
the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a Virgin shall
conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Butter
and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and
choose the good.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke i. 26.

And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a Virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the Virgin's
name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail,
thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee; blessed art
thou among women. And when she saw him she was troubled at his
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should
be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast
found favour with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
and bring forth a Son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall
be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the
Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David.
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel,
How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered
and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that
holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God. And behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived
a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was
called barren: for with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary
said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to
thy word. And the angel departed from her.

SAINT MARK'S DAY _April_ 25.

THE COLLECT.

O almighty God, who hast instructed thy holy Church with the
heavenly doctrine of thy Evangelist Saint Mark: Give us grace,
that, being not like children carried away with every blast of
vain doctrine, we may be established in the truth of thy holy
Gospel; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. iv. 7.

Unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of
the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on
high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that
he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the
lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that
ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists,
and some Pastors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the saints
for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
Christ; till we all come, in the unity of the faith and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be
no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every
wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness,
whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in
love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even
Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body,
unto the edifying of itself in love.

THE GOSPEL. St John xv. 1.

I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch
in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch
that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more
fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except
ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that
abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit;
for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he
is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them,
and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in
me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it
shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath
loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep
my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept
my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things
have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that
your joy might be full.

SAINT PHILIP AND SAINT JAMES'S DAY _May_ 1.

THE COLLECT.

O almighty God, whom truly to know is everlasting life: Grant us
perfectly to know thy Son Jesus Christ to be the way, the truth,
and the life; that, following the steps of thy holy Apostles,
Saint Philip and Saint James, we may stedfastly walk in the way
that leadeth to eternal life; through the same thy Son Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. St James i. 1.

James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
tribes that are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren, count
it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this,
that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience
have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting
nothing. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall
be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for
he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind,
and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any
thing of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his
ways. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted;
but the rich in that he is made low; because as the flower of the
grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a
burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof
falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also
shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Blessed is the man that
endureth temptation; for when he is tried, he shall receive the
crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

THE GOSPEL. St John xiv. 1.

And Jesus said unto his disciples, Let not your  heart be troubled;
ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are
many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to
prepare a place for you: and if I go and prepare a place for you,
I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am,
there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye
know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest,
and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,
the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.
If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from
henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him,
Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto
him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not
known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and
how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that
I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak
unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father that dwelleth in
me, he doeth the works. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and
the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake.
Verily, verily I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he
do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in
my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the
Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

SAINT BARNABAS THE APOSTLE _June_ 11.

THE COLLECT.

O Lord God Almighty, who didst endue thy holy Apostle Barnabas
with singular gifts of the Holy Ghost: Leave us not, we beseech
thee, destitute of thy manifold gifts, nor yet of grace to use
them always to thy honour and glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts xi. 22.

Tidings of these things came unto the ears of the Church which
was in Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should
go as far as Antioch. Who, when he came, and had seen the grace
of God, was glad; and exhorted them all, that with purpose of
heart they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man,
and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was
added unto the Lord. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to
seek Saul. And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves
with the Church, and taught much people: and the disciples were
called Christians first in Antioch. And in these days came prophets
from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there stood up one of them named
Agabus, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be great
dearth throughout all the world; which came to pass in the days
of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every man according to
his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which
dwelt in Judaea: which also they did, and sent it to the elders
by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

THE GOSPEL. St John xv. 12.

This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved
you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I
command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant
knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends;
for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known
unto you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and
ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that
your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
Father in my name, he may give it you.

SAINT JOHN BAPTIST'S DAY _June_ 24.

THE COLLECT. Almighty God, by whose providence thy servant John
Baptist was wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of thy
Son our Saviour, by preaching of repentance: Make us so to follow
his doctrine and holy life, that we may truly repent according to
his preaching, and after his example constantly speak the truth,
boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the truth's sake;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Isaiah xl. 1.

Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye
comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare
is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath
received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins. The voice
of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make straight in the desert a high-way for our God. Every
valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be
made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough
places plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and
all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it. The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?
All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the
flower of the field. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth,
because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people
is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of
our God shall stand for ever. O Zion, that bringest good tidings,
get thee up into the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that bringest
good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not
afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God. Behold, the
Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for
him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. He
shall feed his flock like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead
those that are with young.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke i. 57.

Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she
brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her cousins heard
how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced
with her. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came
to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
name of his father. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but
he shall be called John. And they said unto her, There is none of
thy kindred that is called by this name. And they made signs to
his father, how he would have him called. And he asked for a
writing-table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they
marvelled all. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his
tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. And fear came on
all that dwelt round about them; and all these sayings were noised
abroad throughout all the hill-country of Judaea. And all they
that had heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What
manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was with
him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: for he
hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised up an horn
of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; as he spake
by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the
world began; that we should be saved from our enemies, and from
the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy promised to our
fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; the oath which he sware
to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us, that we,
being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve him
without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the
days of our life. And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of
the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to
prepare his ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto his people,
by the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our
God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us; to give
light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death; to
guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child grew, and waxed
strong in spirit; and was in the deserts till the day of his
shewing unto Israel.

SAINT PETER'S DAY _June_ 29.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to thy
Apostle Saint Peter many excellent gifts, and commandedst him
earnestly to feed thy flock: Make, we beseech thee, all Bishops
and Pastors diligently to preach thy holy Word, and the people
obediently to follow the same, that they may receive the crown
of everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts xii. 1.

About that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex
certain of the Church. And he killed James the brother of John
with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded
further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened
bread.) And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison,
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him,
intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. Peter
therefore was kept in prison; but prayer was made without ceasing
of the Church unto God for him. And when Herod would have brought
him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers,
bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door kept the
prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a
light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and
raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off
from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and
bind on thy sandals: and so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast
thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out and followed
him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but
thought he saw a vision. When they were past the first and the
second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the
city, which opened to them of his own accord; and they went out,
and passed on through one street, and forthwith the angel departed
from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know
of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the
people of the Jews.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xvi. 13.

When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? And
they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias,
and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them,
But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou
art Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said
unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood
hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock
I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven.

to follow thy holy commandments; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts xi. 27, and part of Chapter xii.

In those days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. And there
stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit,
that there should be great dearth throughout all the world; which
came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples,
every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto
the brethren which dwelt at Judaea: which also they did, and sent
it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. Now about that
time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of
the Church. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
take Peter also.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xx. 20.

Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons,
worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. And he said
unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my
two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the
left, in thy kingdom. But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not
what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink
of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
They say unto him, We are able. And he saith unto them, Ye shall
drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not
mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared
of my Father. And when the ten heard it, they were moved with
indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus called them unto
him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise
dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority
upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will
be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will
be chief among you, let him be your servant: even as the Son of
man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
his life a ransom for many.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts v. 12.

By the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
among the people: (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's
porch: and of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
people magnified them: and believers were the more added to the
Lord, multitudes both of men and women:) insomuch that they
brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds
and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by
might overshadow some of them. There came also a multitude out of
the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and
them which were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed
every one.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xxii. 24.

And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the
Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise
authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be
so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is
greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he
that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye
are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I
appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

O almighty God, who by thy blessed Son didst call Matthew from
the receipt of custom to be an Apostle and Evangelist: Grant us

riches, and to follow the same thy Son Jesus Christ, who liveth
and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without
end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 2 Cor. iv. 1.

Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
mercy, we faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of
dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word
of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending
ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if
our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe
not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the
image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves
but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus
sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. ix. 9.

And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man named Matthew,
sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow
me. And he arose, and followed him. And it came to pass, as Jesus
sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came,
and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees
saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with
publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto
them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are
sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy,
and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.

appointment they may succour and defend us on earth; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Rev. xii. 7.

There was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed
not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the
great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into
the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a
loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength,
and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the
accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before
our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the
Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their
lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that
dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea:
for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because
he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xviii. 1.

At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child
unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say
unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children,
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore
shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest
in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little
child in my name, receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of
these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him
that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were
drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of
offences: for it must needs be that offences come: but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh. Wherefore if thy hand or
thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it
is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than
having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire. Take heed
that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you,
that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father
which is in heaven.

Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
an Evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now
ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give
me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that
love his appearing. Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and
is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto
Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with
thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. And Tychicus
have I sent to Ephesus. The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus,
when thou comest, bring with thee; and the books, but especially
the parchments. Alexander the copper-smith did me much evil: the
Lord reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou ware also,
for he hath greatly withstood our words.

THE GOSPEL. St Luke x. 1.

The Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two
before his face into every city and place whither he himself would
come. Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. Go your ways;
behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Carry neither
purse, nor scrip, nor shoes, and salute no man by the way. And
into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it:
if not, it shall turn to you again. And in the same house remain,
eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is
worthy of his hire.

unto thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. St Jude 1.

Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
Jesus Christ, and called: Mercy unto you, and peace, and love
be multiplied. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto
you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto
you, and exhort you, that ye should earnestly contend for the
faith which was once delivered unto the saints. For there are
certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to
this condemnation; ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into
lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus
Christ. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once
knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. And
the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgement of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha,
and the cities about them, in like manner giving themselves over
to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for
an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Likewise also
these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and
speak evil of dignities.

THE GOSPEL. St John xv. 17.

These things I command you, that ye love one another. If the world
hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were
of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not
of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The
servant is not greater than the lord: if they have persecuted
me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying,
they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto
you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. If
I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now
they have no cloke for their sin. He that hateth me hateth my
Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none
other man did, they had not had sin; but now have they both seen
and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that
the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They
hated me without a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I
will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which
proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: and ye also
shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.

FOR THE EPISTLE. Rev. vii. 2.

And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four
angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth, and the sea,
saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till
we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And I
heard the number of them which were sealed; and there were sealed
an hundred and forty and four thousand, of all the tribes of the
children of Israel.

Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand.

Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand.

Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.

Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand.

Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand.

Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could
number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,
stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white
robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice,
saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and
unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the throne,
and about the elders, and the four beasts, and fell before the
throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen; Blessing,
and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power,
and might, be unto our God for ever and ever: Amen.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. v. 1.

Jesus, seeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain; and when
he was set, his disciples came unto him. And he opened his mouth,
and taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn:
for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall
inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the
merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peace-makers: for
they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which
are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute
you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my
sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in
heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

| and not evil all the days of her life. She seeketh wool, and
| flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the
| merchants ships; she bringeth her food from afar. She riseth
| also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household,
| and a portion to her maidens. She considereth a field, and
| buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planeth a vineyard.
| She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
| She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
| not out by night. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her
| hands hold the distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the
| poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. She is
| not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household
| are clothed with scarlet. She maketh herself coverings of
| tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. Her husband is
| known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the
| land. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth
| girdles unto the merchant. Strength and honour are her clothing;
| and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth
| with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She
| looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the
| bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed;
| her husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done
| virtuously, but thou excellest them all. Favour is deceitful,
| and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she
| shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let
| her own works praise her in the gates.
|
| THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xiii. 44.
|
| The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field;
| the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof
| goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
| Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
| seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of
| great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
|
| AT THE DEDICATION FESTIVAL
|
| THE COLLECT.
|
| Almighty God, whom year by year we praise for the dedication
| of this church, and who hast preserved us in safety to worship
| therein; Hear, we beseech thee, the prayers of thy people, and
| grant that whosoever in this place shall make his supplication
| before thee, may by the granting of his petitions be filled
| with joy to the glory of thy holy Name, through Jesus Christ
| our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| THE EPISTLE. 1 St Peter ii. 1.
|
| Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
| and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire
| the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: if so
| be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as
| unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God,
| and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual
| house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
| acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained
| in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone,
| elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be
| confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious:
| but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders
| disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a
| stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which
| stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they
| were appointed. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
| priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should
| shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of
| darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were
| not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not
| obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
|
| THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxi. 12.
|
| Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that
| sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the
| money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and
| said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the
| house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. And the
| blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed
| them. And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
| things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
| saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
| and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith
| unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes
| and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
|
| AT THE THANKSGIVING FOR HARVEST
|
| THE COLLECTS.
|
| _One or more of these Collects may be said_.
|
| O almighty and everlasting God, who hast given unto us the
| fruits of the earth in their season, and hast crowned the year
| with thy goodness: Give us grateful hearts, that we may unfeignedly
| thank thee for all thy loving-kindness, and worthily magnify thy
| holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful
| people, that they who have freely received of thy bounty, may,
| of thy bounty, freely give; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
| _Amen_.
|
| O Lord Jesus Christ, who hast taught us that man doth not live
| by bread alone: Feed us, we humbly beseech thee, with the true
| Bread that cometh down from heaven, even thyself, O blessed
| Saviour, who livest and reignest, with the Father and the Holy
| Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.
|
| FOR THE EPISTLE. Deut. xvi. 13.
|
| Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
| that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: and thou
| shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter,
| and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the
| stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within
| thy gates. Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the
| Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose: because
| the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in
| all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.
|
| THE GOSPEL. St Matth. vi. 28.
|
| Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
| neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon
| in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore,
| if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and
| to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe
| you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying,
| What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal
| shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the Gentiles
| seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of
| all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
| his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto
| you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow
| shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto
| the day is the evil thereof.
|
| SOLEMNIZATION OF MATRIMONY
|
| THE COLLECT.
|
| O heavenly Father who didst join together in marriage our first
| parents, Adam and Eve: Sanctify and bless these thy servants;
| and grant that those whom thou by matrimony dost make one, may
| stedfastly keep the covenant betwixt them made, and ever remain
| in perfect love and peace together; through Jesus Christ our
| Lord. _Amen_.
|
| THE EPISTLE. Ephes. v. 25.
|
| Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church,
| and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it
| with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it
| to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or
| any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
| So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
| loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his
| own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord
| the Church: for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and
| of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and
| mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall
| be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning
| Christ and the Church. Nevertheless let every one of you in
| particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see
| that she reverence her husband.
|
| THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xix. 4.
|
| Jesus answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
| | which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
| and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
| and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
| flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
| therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
|
| BURIAL OF THE DEAD
|
| THE COLLECT.
|
| O merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
| the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth
| shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth, and believeth
| in him, shall not die eternally; who also hath taught us (by
| his holy Apostle Saint Paul) not to be sorry, as men without
| hope, for them that sleep in him: We meekly beseech thee, O
| Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of
| righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may
| rest in him, as our hope is this our brother doth; and that,
| at the general resurrection in the last day, we may be found
| acceptable in thy sight, and receive that blessing, which thy
| well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear
| thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive
| the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world:
| Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus
| Christ, our Mediator and Redeemer. _Amen_.
|
| THE EPISTLE. 1 Thess. iv. 13.
|
| I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
| which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have
| no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even
| so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For
| this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
| alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
| them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from
| heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
| the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then
| we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
| them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall
| we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with
| these words.
|
| THE GOSPEL. St John vi. 37.
|
| All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
| cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from
| heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent
| me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of
| all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should
| raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him
| that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth
| on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at
| the last day.
|
| _Or_ St John xi. 21.
|
| Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
| brother had not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever
| thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith unto
| her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I
| know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last
| day. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
| he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
| live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never
| die. Believest thou this? She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I
| believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should
| come into the world.




THE SCOTTISH LITURGY

FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE HOLY EUCHARIST

AND ADMINISTRATION OF HOLY COMMUNION

COMMONLY CALLED THE SCOTTISH COMMUNION OFFICE


_The Holy Table, having at the Communion time a fair white linen
cloth upon it, with other decent furniture meet for the high
Mysteries there to be celebrated, shall stand at the uppermost
part of the Chancel or Church. And the Presbyter, standing at the
Holy Table, shall say the Lord's Prayer, with the collect following
for due preparation, the people kneeling_.

Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But
deliver us from evil. Amen.

_The Collect_.

Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and
from whom no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love
thee, and worthily magnify thy holy Name; through Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

_Then shall the Presbyter, turning to the people, rehearse
distinctly all the Ten Commandments: the people all the while
kneeling, and asking God mercy for the transgression of every
duty therein, according to the letter or to the spiritual import
of each Commandment, and grace to keep the same for the time to
come_.

God spake these words and said; I am the Lord thy God: Thou shalt
have none other gods but me.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor
the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth
beneath, or in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down
to them, nor worship them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shew mercy unto
thousands in them that love me, and keep my commandments.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in
vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless, that taketh his
Name in vain.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath-day. Six
days shalt thou labour, and do all that thou hast to do; but the
seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt
do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy
man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger
that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
day: wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may
be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt do no murder.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt not steal.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Presbyter_. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his servant, nor his
maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws
in our hearts, we beseech thee.

| _Or he may rehearse, instead of the Ten Commandments, the Summary
| of the Law as followeth_:
|
| Our Lord Jesus Christ said: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is
| one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
| and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
| strength: This is the first commandment. And the second is like,
| namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: there is
| none other commandment greater than these.
|
| On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.
|
| _People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and write these thy laws in
| our hearts, we beseech thee.

_Or else instead of the Ten Commandments or the Summary of the
Law, may be sung or said on week-days, not being Great Festivals,
as followeth_:

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Then the Presbyter shall say_,

The Lord be with you.

_Answer_. And with thy spirit.

_Presbyter_. Let us pray.

_Then the Presbyter, turning to the Holy Table, shall say the
Collect, or Collects; and then the Presbyter, or some other
Presbyter or Deacon, shall read the Epistle, saying_, The Epistle
[_or_, The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle] is
written in the------chapter of------beginning at the------verse.
_And, the Epistle ended, he shall say_, Here endeth the Epistle.
_Then shall the Presbyter, or some other Presbyter or Deacon, read
the Gospel, saying_, The Holy Gospel is written in the------chapter
of the Gospel according to------, beginning at the------verse; _and
the people, all standing up, shall devoutly sing or say_,

Glory be to thee, O Lord.

_And, the Gospel ended, the people shall in like manner sing or
say_,

Thanks be to thee, O Lord, for this thy glorious Gospel.

_Then shall be sung or said this Creed following, the people still
reverently standing_.

I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth, And of all things visible and invisible:

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, Begotten
of his Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very
God of Very God, Begotten, not made, Being of one substance with
the Father; By whom all things were made: Who for us men, and for
our salvation came down from heaven, And was incarnate by the Holy
Ghost of the Virgin Mary, And was made man, And was crucified also
for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried, And the
third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, And ascended
into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of the Father. And he
shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead:
Whose kingdom shall have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Lord, and Giver of life, Who
proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Who with the Father and the
Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the Prophets.
And I believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one
Baptism for the remission of sins. And I look for the Resurrection
of the dead, And the life of the world to come. Amen.

_Then the Presbyter shall declare unto the people what Holy-days
or Fasting-days are in the week to be observed. And also (if
occasion be) notice shall be given of the Holy Communion; banns
of Matrimony may be published; and, subject to the authority of
the Bishop, other notices may be read_.

_If there be a Sermon it followeth here_.

_When the Presbyter giveth learning of the Holy Communion he may,
at his discretion, use the first or the second of the Exhortations
appended to this Liturgy_.

_The third Exhortation appended to this Liturgy may be used at the
discretion of the Presbyter before the Offertory, the people
standing_.

_Then the Presbyter, or Deacon, shall say_,

Let us present our offerings to the Lord with reverence and godly
fear.

_Then the Presbyter shall begin the Offertory, saying one or more
of these sentences following, as he thinketh most convenient_.

In process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also
brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof.
And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto
Cain and to his offering he had not respect. _Gen_. iv. 3, 4, 5.

Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering:
of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take
my offering. _Exod_. xxv. 2.

Ye shall not appear before the Lord empty. Every man shall give as
he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he
hath given thee. _Deut_. xvi. 16, 17.

I will offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness; I
will sing and speak praises unto the Lord. _Ps_. xxvii. 7.

Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
_Ps_. 1. 14.

Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name: bring an offering,
and come into his courts. _Ps_. xcvi. 8.

I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call
upon the Name of the Lord; I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the
sight of all his people. _Ps_. cxvi. 15, 16.

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up
for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
_St Matth_. vi. 19, 20.

Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father which
is in heaven. _St Matth_. vii. 21.

Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast
money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And
there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which
make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and saith
unto them, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast
more in than all they which have cast into the treasury. For all
they did cast in of their abundance: but she of her want did cast
in all that she had, even all her living. _St Mark_ xii. 41, 42,
43, 44.

Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
blessed to give than to receive. _Acts_ xx. 35.

Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a
vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a
flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 1 _Cor_. ix. 7.

If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if
we shall reap your carnal things? 1 _Cor_. ix. 11.

Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are
partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they
which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. 1 _Cor_. ix.
13, 14.

He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly: and he which
soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according
as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or
of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 2 _Cor_. ix. 6, 7.

Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked:
for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. _Gal_. vi.
6, 7.

As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men; especially
unto them who are of the household of faith. _Gal_. vi. 10.

Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high
minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy: That they do good, that they
be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. 1 _Tim_. vi.
17, 18, 19.

God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,
which ye have shewed toward his Name, in that ye have ministered
to the saints, and do minister. _Heb_. vi. 10.

To do good and to communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices
God is well pleased. _Heb_. xiii. 16.

_While the Presbyter distinctly pronounceth one or more of these
sentences for the Offertory, the Deacon, or_ (_if no such be
present_) _some other fit person, shall receive the devotions of
the people there present, in a bason provided for that purpose.
And when all have offered, he shall reverently bring the said bason,
with the offerings therein, and deliver it to the Presbyter; who
shall humbly present it before the Lord, and set it upon the Holy
Table_.

_And the Presbyter shall then, offer up, and place the bread and
wine prepared for the Sacrament upon the Lord's Table; and shall
say_,

Blessed be thou, O Lord God, for ever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is
the greatness, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty:
for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine: thine is
the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all: both
riches and honour come of thee, and of thine own do we give unto
thee. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Presbyter say_,

The Lord be with you.

_Answer_. And with thy spirit.

_Presbyter_. Lift up your hearts.

_Answer_. We lift them up unto the Lord.

_Presbyter_. Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.

_Answer_. It is meet and right so to do.

_Presbyter_.

It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at
all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord, *
[holy Father,] Almighty, everlasting God.

[Margin Note:] * _These words_ [holy Father] _must be omitted on
Trinity Sunday_

_Here shall follow the proper preface, according to the time, if
there be appointed; or else immediately shall follow_,

Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company of
heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name, evermore praising
thee and saying,

_Presbyter and People_.

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Of hosts, heaven and earth are full of
thy glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord most high. Amen.



PROPER PREFACES.

_Upon_ CHRISTMAS-DAY, _and seven days after_.

Because thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be
born * [as on this day] for us, who, by the operation of the
Holy Ghost, was made very man, of the substance of the blessed
Virgin Mary his mother, and that without spot of sin, to make us
clean from all sin. Therefore with Angels, &c.

[Margin Note:] *_During the seven days after Christmas say_, as at
this time.

_Upon_ EASTER-DAY, _and seven days after_.

But chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious Resurrection
of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord: For he is the very Paschal Lamb
which was offered for us, and hath taken away the sin of the world;
who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his rising to life
again, hath restored to us everlasting life. Therefore with Angels,
&c.

_Upon_ ASCENSION-DAY, _and seven days after_.

Through thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who,
after his most glorious Resurrection, manifestly appeared to all
his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven, to prepare
a place for us; that where he is, thither might we also ascend,
and reign with him in glory. Therefore with Angels, &c.

_Upon_ PENTECOST _or_ WHITSUNDAY, _and six days after_.

Through Jesus Christ our Lord; according to whose most true
promise, the Holy Ghost came down * [as on this day] from heaven
with a sudden great sound, as it had been a mighty wind, in the
likeness of fiery tongues, lighting upon the Apostles, to teach
them, and to lead them to all truth, giving them both the gift of
tongues, and also boldness with fervent zeal constantly to preach
the Gospel unto all nations; whereby we have been brought out of
darkness and error into the clear light and true knowledge of thee,
and of thy Son Jesus Christ. Therefore with Angels, &c.

[Margin Note:] * _During the six days after Whitsunday say_, as
at this time.

_Upon the Feast of_ TRINITY _only_.

Who art one God, one Lord; not one only Person, but three Persons
in one Substance. For that which we believe of the glory of the
Father, the same we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
without any difference or inequality. Therefore with Angels, &c.

| _The following may be used at the discretion of the Minister_.
|
| ADDITIONAL PROPER PREFACES.
|
| _Upon_ THE EPIPHANY, _and seven days after_.
|
| Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, in substance of our mortal
| flesh, manifested forth his glory, that he might bring us out of
| darkness into his own marvellous light. Therefore with Angels, &c.
|
| _Upon_ THE PURIFICATION.
|
| Because thy blessed Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, born of a woman,
| born under the Law, was, as on this day, presented in the Temple,
| and revealed to thy servants as a light to lighten the Gentiles
| and the glory of thy people Israel. Therefore with Angels, &c.
|
| _Upon_ THE ANNUNCIATION.
|
| Because thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be born
| for us, who by the operation of the Holy Ghost, was made very man,
| of the substance of the blessed Virgin Mary his mother, and that
| without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin. Therefore with
| Angels, &c.
|
| _Upon_ FEASTS OF APOSTLES AND EVANGELISTS, _except when the_
| _proper preface for any of the Great Festivals is appointed to_
| _be said_.
|
| Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who did vouchsafe to choose thy
| servant, Saint _N_. [_or_ thy servants Saint _N_. and Saint _N_.],
| to be of the company of the Apostles [_or_ to be an Evangelist],
| by whose ministry thine elect might be gathered in from every
| nation, and thy Church instructed in the way that leadeth unto
| everlasting life. Therefore with Angels, &c.
|
| _Upon_ ALL SAINTS DAY.
|
| Who in the multitude of thy Saints hast compassed us about with
| so great a cloud of witnesses, to the end that we, rejoicing in
| their fellowship, may run with patience the race that is set
| before us, and together with them receive the crown of glory
| that fadeth not away. Therefore with Angels, &c.
|
| _At the_ CONSECRATION OF BISHOPS, _and_ ORDINATION OF PRIESTS AND
| DEACONS.
|
| Through Jesus Christ our Lord, the great Shepherd of the sheep,
| who, for the feeding and guidance of his flock, did appoint divers
| orders of ministers in his Church. Therefore with Angels, &c.
|
| _At the_ DEDICATION OF A CHURCH, _and_ ANNIVERSARY OF THE
| DEDICATION.
|
| Who in temples made with hands buildest up for thyself a
| spiritual temple made without hands. Therefore with Angels, &c.

_After which prefaces shall follow immediately this doxology_;

Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company of
heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name; evermore praising
thee, and saying,

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of
thy glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord most high. Amen.

[Margin Note:] _Presbyter and People_.

_Then the Presbyter, standing at such a part of the Holy Table
as he may with the most ease and decency use both his hands,
shall say the prayer of consecration, as followeth_:

All glory be to thee, Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for that
thou of thy tender mercy didst give thine only Son Jesus Christ to
suffer death upon the cross for our redemption; who, by his own
oblation of himself once offered, made a full, perfect, and
sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins
of the whole world, and did institute, and in his holy Gospel
command us to continue a perpetual memorial of that his precious
death and sacrifice until his coming again. For, in the night that
he was betrayed, (a) he took bread; and when he had given thanks,
(b) he brake it, and gave it to his disciples, Saying, Take, eat,
(c) this is my body, is given for you: Do this in remembrance of
me. Likewise after supper (d) he took the cup; and when he had
given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this,
for (e) this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
you and for many for the remission of sins: Do this as oft as ye
shall drink it in remembrance of me.

[Margin Notes:] a. _Here the Presbyter is to take the paten in his
hands_:

b. _And here to break the bread_:

c. _And here to lay his hands upon all the bread_.

d. _Here he is to take the cup into his hand_:

e. _And here to lay his hand upon every vessel (be it chalice or
flagon) in which there is any wine to be consecrated_.

Wherefore, O Lord, and heavenly Father, according to the institution
of thy * dearly beloved Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, we thy
humble servants do celebrate and make here before thy divine
Majesty, with these thy holy gifts, which we now offer unto thee,
the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to make; having in remembrance
his blessed passion, and precious death, his mighty resurrection,
and  glorious ascension; rendering unto thee most hearty thanks for
the innumerable benefits procured unto us by the same, and looking
for his coming again with power and great glory.

[Margin Note:] * The Oblation.

And, humbly praying that it may be unto us according to his word,
* we thine unworthy servants beseech thee, most merciful Father,
to hear us, and to send thy Holy Spirit upon us and upon these
thy gifts and creatures of bread and wine, that, being blessed
and hallowed by his life-giving power, they may become the body
and blood of thy most dearly beloved Son, to the end that all who
shall receive the same may be sanctified both in body and soul,
and preserved unto everlasting life.

[Margin Note:] * The Invocation.

And we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness, mercifully to
accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, most humbly
beseeching thee to grant, that by the merits and death of thy Son
Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we and all thy whole
Church may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits of
his passion.

And here we humbly offer and present unto thee, O Lord, ourselves,
our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living
sacrifice unto thee, beseeching thee that all we who shall be
partakers of this holy Communion, may worthily receive the most
precious body and blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, and be fulfilled
with thy grace and heavenly benediction, and made one body with him,
that he may dwell in us and we in him.

And although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer
unto thee any sacrifice; yet we beseech thee to accept this our
bounden duty and service, not weighing our merits, but pardoning
our offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord: by whom, and with
whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be
unto thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Presbyter or Deacon say_,

Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church.

_The Presbyter_.

Almighty and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle hast taught
us to make prayers and supplications, and to give thanks for all
men; We humbly beseech thee most mercifully to receive these our
prayers, which we offer unto thy divine Majesty; beseeching thee
to inspire continually the universal Church with the spirit of
truth, unity, and concord; and grant that all they that do confess
thy holy Name, may agree in the truth of thy holy word, and live
in unity and godly love. We beseech thee also to save and defend
all Christian Kings, Princes, and Governors, and especially thy
servant _GEORGE_ our King, that under him we may be godly and
quietly governed: and grant unto his whole council, and to all
who are put in authority under him, that they may truly and
impartially minister justice, to the punishment of wickedness and
vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion and virtue. Give
grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
that they may both by their life and doctrine set forth thy true and
living word, and rightly and duly administer thy holy sacraments:
and to all thy people give thy heavenly grace, that with meek heart,
and due reverence, they may hear and receive thy holy word, truly
serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of their
life. And we commend especially to thy merciful goodness the
congregation which is here assembled in thy Name, to celebrate
the commemoration of the most precious death and sacrifice of thy
Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. And we most humbly beseech thee of
thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort and succour all those who in this
transitory life are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any
other adversity. And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy
servants, who, having finished their course in faith, do now rest
from their labours. And we yield unto thee most high praise and
hearty thanks, for the wonderful grace and virtue declared in all
thy saints, who have been the choice vessels of thy grace, and the
lights of the world in their several generations: most humbly
beseeching thee to give us grace to follow the example of their
steadfastness in thy faith, and obedience to thy holy commandments,
that at the day of the general resurrection, we, and all they who
are of the mystical body of thy Son, may be set on his right hand,
and hear that his most joyful voice, Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world. Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's sake, our only
Mediator and Advocate. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Presbyter say_,

As our Saviour Christ hath commanded and taught us, we are bold
to say,

Our Father, which art in heaven, * Hallowed be thy Name, Thy
kingdom come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation; But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
The power, and the glory, Forever and ever. Amen.

[Margin Note:] * _Presbyter and People_.

_Then the Presbyter or Deacon shall say this invitation to them
that come to receive the Holy Communion_,

Ye that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and are
in love and charity with your neighbours, and intend to lead a new
life, following the commandments of God, and walking from henceforth
in his holy ways; Draw near with faith, and take this holy Sacrament
to your comfort; and make your humble confession to Almighty God,
meekly kneeling upon your knees.

_Then shall this general confession be made by the people, along
with the Presbyter; he first kneeling down_.

Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all
things, Judge of all men; We acknowledge and bewail our manifold
sins and wickedness, Which we, from time to time, most grievously
have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against thy divine
Majesty, Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against
us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these our
misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The burden
of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, Have mercy upon us,
most merciful Father; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
Forgive us all that is past; And grant, that we may ever hereafter
Serve and please thee In newness of life, To the honour and glory
of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

_Then shall the Presbyter, or the Bishop, if he be present,
stand up, and, turning himself to the people, pronounce the
Absolution as followeth_:

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who, of his great mercy, hath
promised forgiveness of sins to all them who with hearty repentance
and true faith turn unto him, Have mercy upon you; pardon and
deliver you from all your sins; confirm and strengthen you in
all goodness; and bring you to everlasting life, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Presbyter also say_,

Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith unto all
that truly turn to him.

Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest. _St Matth_. xi. 28.

God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life. _St John_ iii. 16.

Hear also what Saint Paul saith.

This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. 1 _Tim_. i. 15.

Hear also what Saint John saith.

If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins. 1 _St John_
ii. 1, 2.

_Then shall the Presbyter, turning him to the Altar, kneel down,
and say, in the name of all them that shall communicate, this
collect of humble access to the Holy Communion, as followeth_:

We do not presume to come to this thy holy Table, O merciful Lord,
trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great
mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs
under thy Table: but thou art the same Lord, whose property is
always to have mercy. Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to
eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his
blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his most sacred
body, and our souls washed through his most precious blood, and
that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. _Amen_.

_Then shall he that celebrateth first receive the Communion in
both kinds himself, and next deliver the same to the Bishops,
Presbyters, and Deacons_ (_if there be any present_), _and after
to the people in due order, into their hands, all humbly kneeling.
And when he receiveth himself or delivereth the Sacrament of the
body of Christ to any other, he shall say_,

The body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life.

_Here the person receiving shall say_, Amen.

_And the Presbyter that receiveth the Cup himself, as likewise
the Presbyter or Deacon that delivereth it to any other, shall
say_,

The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life.

_Here the person receiving shall say_, Amen.

_If the consecrated bread or wine be all spent before all have
communicated, the Presbyter is to consecrate more in both kinds,
according to the form before prescribed, beginning at the words_,
All glory be to thee, &c., _and ending with the words_, preserved
unto everlasting life. _And the people shall say_, Amen.

_When all have communicated, he that celebrateth shall go to the
Lord's Table, and cover with a fair linen cloth that which remaineth
of the consecrated elements_.

_Then the Presbyter or Deacon, turning to the people, shall say_,

Having now received the precious body and blood of Christ, let us
give thanks to our Lord God, who hath graciously vouchsafed to
admit us to the participation of his holy mysteries; and let us
beg of him grace to perform our vows, and to persevere in our good
resolutions; and that being made holy, we may obtain everlasting
life, through the merits of the all-sufficient sacrifice of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

_This exhortation may be omitted except on Sundays and the Great
Festivals_.

_Then the Presbyter shall say this collect of thanksgiving as
followeth_:

Almighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, for that
thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who have duly received these holy
mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious body and
blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost assure us
thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us, and that we are
very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, which
is the blessed company of all faithful people, and are also heirs
through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of his most
precious death and passion. We now most humbly beseech thee, O
heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy Holy Spirit, that we
may continue in that holy communion and fellowship, and do all
such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in, through
Jesus Christ our Lord: to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be
all honour and glory, world without end. _Amen_.

_Then shall be said or sung_ Gloria in excelsis _as followeth_:

Glory be to God in the highest, and in earth peace, good will
towards men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we
glorify thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord
God, heavenly King, God the Father Almighty; and to thee, O God,
the only begotten Son Jesu Christ; and to thee, O God, the Holy
Ghost.

O Lord, the only begotten Son Jesu Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of
God, Son of the Father, who takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the
Father, have mercy upon us.

For thou only art holy, thou only art the Lord, thou only, O
Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God
the Father. Amen.

_Then the Presbyter, or Bishop, if he be present, shall let them
depart, with this Blessing_.

The peace of God which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord: and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and remain with you always.
_Amen_.

_It is customary to mix a little pure water with the wine in the
eucharistic Cup_.

_According to long existing custom in the Scottish Church, the
Presbyter may reserve so much of the Consecrated Gifts as may be
required for the communion of the sick, and others who could not
be present at the celebration in church. All that remaineth of the
Holy Sacrament, and is not required, the Presbyter and such other
of the communicants as he shall then call unto him, shall, after
the Blessing, reverently eat and drink_.




APPENDIX

_The following may be used at the discretion of the Minister_.

_Collects which may be said after the Collect of the day, or before
the Blessing_.

O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, in
the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that
through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be
preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. _Amen_.

O almighty Father, well-spring of life to all things that have
being, from amid the unwearied praises of Cherubim and Seraphim
who stand about thy throne of light which no man can approach
unto, give ear, we humbly beseech thee, to the supplications of
thy people who put their sure trust in thy mercy; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

O Lord Jesus Christ, before whose judgement-seat we must all
appear and give account of the things done in the body: Grant,
we beseech thee, that when the books are opened in that day, the
faces of thy servants may not be ashamed; through thy merits, O
Blessed Saviour, who livest and reignest with the Father and the
Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.

Assist us mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplications and
prayers, and dispose the way of thy servants towards the attainment
of everlasting salvation; that among all the changes and chances
of this mortal life, they may ever be defended by thy most gracious
and ready help; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy most gracious
favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy
Name, and finally by thy mercy obtain everlasting life; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, who knowest our necessities
before we ask, and our ignorance in asking; We beseech thee to have
compassion upon our infirmities; and those things, which for our
unworthiness we dare not, and for our blindness we cannot ask,
vouchsafe to give us, for the worthiness of thy Son Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

_The two following collects may be said before the Blessing_.

O Lord, our God, thou Saviour of the world, through whom we have
celebrated these sacred mysteries: Receive our humble thanksgiving,
and of thy great mercy vouchsafe to sanctify us evermore in body
and soul, who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.

Almighty God, who hast promised to hear the petitions of them
that ask in thy Son's Name; We beseech thee mercifully to incline
thine ears to us that have made now our prayers and supplications
unto thee; and grant that those things, which we have faithfully
asked according to thy will, may effectually be obtained, to the
relief of our necessity, and to the setting forth of thy glory;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_For the King, on national anniversaries and on other occasions_.

Almighty God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and power infinite;
Have mercy upon the whole Church; and so rule the heart of thy
chosen servant _GEORGE_, our King and Governor, that he (knowing
whose minister he is) may above all things seek thy honour and
glory: and that we, and all his subjects (duly considering whose
authority he hath) may faithfully serve, honour, and humbly obey
him, in thee, and for thee, according to thy blessed Word and
ordinance; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the
Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth, ever one God, world without end.
_Amen_.

_Or_,

Almighty and everlasting God, we are taught by thy holy Word,
that the hearts of Kings are in thy rule and governance, and that
thou dost dispose and turn them as it seemeth best to thy godly
wisdom: We humbly beseech thee so to dispose and govern the heart
of _GEORGE_, thy servant, our King and Governor, that in all his
thoughts, words, and works, he may ever seek thy honour and glory,
and study to preserve thy people committed to his charge, in
wealth, peace, and godliness: Grant this, O merciful Father, for
thy dear Son's sake, Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.




PRAYERS FOR CERTAIN FESTIVALS AND SEASONS,


_which may be said immediately before the Blessing_.

_Advent_.

Grant, O almighty God, that as thy blessed Son Jesus Christ at
his first advent came to seek and to save that which was lost,
so at his second and glorious appearing he may find in us the
fruits of the redemption which he wrought, who liveth and reigneth,
with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.

_Christmas-day, and seven days after_.

O God, who hast given us grace at this time to celebrate the
birth of our Saviour, Jesus Christ: We laud and magnify thy
glorious Name for the countless blessings which he hath brought
unto us; and we beseech thee to grant that we may ever set forth
thy praise in joyful obedience to thy will; through the same Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Epiphany, and seven days after_.

Almighty God, who at the baptism of thy blessed Son Jesus Christ
in the river Jordan didst manifest his glorious Godhead: Grant,
we beseech thee, that the brightness of his presence may shine in
our hearts, and his glory be set forth in our lives; through the
same Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Easter-day, and seven days after_.

O Lord God Almighty, whose blessed Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
did on the third day rise triumphant over death: Raise us, we
beseech thee, from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness,
that we may seek those things which are above, where he sitteth on
thy right hand in glory; and this we beg for the sake of the same,
thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Ascension-day, and seven days after_.

Almighty God, whose blessed Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things:
Mercifully give us faith to perceive that according to his promise
he abideth with his Church on earth, even unto the end of the
world; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Whitsunday, and six days after_.

O almighty God, who on the day of Pentecost didst send the Holy
Ghost the Comforter to abide in thy Church unto the end: Bestow
upon us and upon all thy faithful people his manifold gifts of
grace, that with minds enlightened by his truth, and hearts
purified by his presence, we may day by day be strengthened with
power in the inward man; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with
thee and the same Spirit liveth and reigneth, one God, world
without end. _Amen_.

_Trinity Sunday_.

O Lord God Almighty, Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the mysteries
of whose being are unsearchable: Accept, we beseech thee, our
praises for the revelation which thou hast made of thyself, Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons, and one God; and mercifully
grant, that ever holding fast this faith, we may magnify thy
glorious Name; who livest and reignest, one God, world without
end. _Amen_.


EXHORTATIONS BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.

Dearly beloved, on------day next I purpose, through God's
assistance, to administer to all such as shall be religiously
and devoutly disposed the most comfortable Sacrament of the Body
and Blood of Christ; to be by them received in remembrance of his
meritorious cross and passion; whereby alone we obtain remission
of our sins, and are made partakers of the kingdom of heaven.
Wherefore it is our duty to render most humble and hearty thanks
to Almighty God our heavenly Father, for that he hath given his
Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, not only to die for us, but also to
be our spiritual food and sustenance in that holy Sacrament. Which
being so divine and comfortable a thing to them who receive it
worthily, and so dangerous to them that will presume to receive it
unworthily; my duty is to exhort you in the mean season to consider
the dignity of that holy mystery, and the great peril of the
unworthy receiving thereof; and so to search and examine your own
consciences, (and that not lightly, and after the manner of
dissemblers with God; but so) that ye may come holy and clean
to such a heavenly Feast, in the marriage-garment required by
God in holy Scripture, and be received as worthy partakers of
that holy Table.

The way and means thereto is; First, to examine your lives and
conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever
ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will,
word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to
confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of
life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are not
only against God, but also against your neighbours; then ye shall
reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make restitution
and satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for
all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being likewise
ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would have
forgiveness of your offences at God's hand; for otherwise the
receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing else but increase your
guilt. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer
or slanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy,
or in any other grievous crime, repent you of your sins, or else
come not to that holy Table; lest, after the taking of that holy
Sacrament, the devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and
fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both
of body and soul.

And because it is requisite, that no man should come to the holy
Communion, but with a full trust in God's mercy, and with a quiet
conscience; therefore if there be any of you, who by this means
cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further
comfort or counsel, let him come to me, or to some other discreet
and learned Minister of God's Word, and open his grief; that by
the ministry of God's holy Word he may receive the benefit of
absolution, together with ghostly counsel and advice, to the
quieting of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple and
doubtfulness.

_The following may be said, instead of the former, in case the
Presbyter shall see the people negligent to come to the Holy
Communion_.

Dearly beloved brethren, on------I intend, by God's grace, to
celebrate the Lord's Supper: unto which, in God's behalf, I bid
you all that are here present; and beseech you, for the Lord Jesus
Christ's sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so
lovingly called and bidden by God himself. Ye know how grievous
and unkind a thing it is, when a man hath prepared a rich feast,
decked his table with all kind of provision, so that there lacketh
nothing but the guests to sit down; and yet they who are called
(without any cause) most unthankfully refuse to come. Which of
you in such a case would not be moved? Who would not think a great
injury and wrong done unto him? Wherefore, most dearly beloved in
Christ, take ye good heed, lest ye, withdrawing yourselves from
this holy supper, provoke God's indignation against you. It is an
easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate, because I am
otherwise hindered with worldly business. But such excuses are not
so easily accepted and allowed before God. If any man say, I am a
grievous sinner, and therefore am afraid to come: wherefore then
do ye not repent and amend? When God calleth you, are ye not
ashamed to say ye will not come? When ye should return to God,
will ye excuse yourselves, and say ye are not ready? Consider
earnestly with yourselves how little such feigned excuses will
avail before God. They that refused the feast in the Gospel,
because they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of oxen,
or because they were married, were not so excused, but counted
unworthy of the heavenly feast. I, for my part, shall be ready;
and according to mine Office, I bid you in the Name of God, I
call you in Christ's behalf, I exhort you, as ye love your own
salvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion. And
as the Son of God did vouchsafe to yield up his soul by death upon
the Cross for your salvation; so it is your duty to receive the
Communion in remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, as he
himself hath commanded: which if ye shall neglect to do, consider
with yourselves how great injury ye do unto God, and how sore
punishment hangeth over your heads for the same; when ye wilfully
abstain from the Lord's Table, and separate from your brethren,
who come to feed on the banquet of that most heavenly food. These
things if ye earnestly consider, ye will by God's grace return to
a better mind: for the obtaining whereof we shall not cease to
make our humble petitions unto Almighty God our heavenly Father.

EXHORTATION AT THE HOLY COMMUNION.

Dearly beloved in the Lord, ye that mind to come to the holy
Communion of the body and blood of our Saviour Christ, must
consider what St Paul writeth to the Corinthians; how he exhorteth
all persons diligently to try and examine themselves, before they
presume to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For as the
benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart and living faith
we receive that holy Sacrament, (for then we spiritually eat the
flesh of Christ, and drink his blood; then we dwell in Christ,
and Christ in us; we are one with Christ, and Christ with us);
so is the danger great, if we receive the same unworthily; for
then we are guilty of the body and blood of Christ our Saviour;
we eat and drink judgement to ourselves, not discerning the Lord's
body; we kindle God's wrath against us; we provoke him to plague
us with divers diseases, and sundry kinds of death. Judge therefore
yourselves, brethren, that ye be not judged of the Lord; repent
you truly for your sins past; have a living and stedfast faith in
Christ our Saviour; amend your lives, and be in perfect charity
with all men: so shall ye be meet partakers of those holy mysteries.
And, above all things, ye must give humble and hearty thanks to
God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the redemption
of the world, by the death and passion of our Saviour Christ, both
God and man, who did humble himself even to the death upon the
Cross for us miserable sinners, who lay in darkness and the shadow
of death, that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us
to everlasting life. And to the end that we should always remember
the exceeding great love of our Master and only Saviour Jesus
Christ thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits which by
his precious blood-shedding he hath obtained to us, he hath
instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as pledges of his love,
and for a continual remembrance of his death, to our great and
endless comfort. To him therefore, with the Father, and the Holy
Ghost, let us give (as we are most bounden) continual thanks,
submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will and pleasure, and
studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness all the
days of our life. _Amen_.




THE ORDER FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF

THE LORD'S SUPPER, OR HOLY COMMUNION


_So many as intend to be partakers of the holy Communion shall
signify their names to the Curate, at least some time the day
before. And if any of those be an open and notorious evil liver,
or have done any wrong to his neighbours by word or deed, so that
the Congregation be thereby offended; the Curate, having knowledge
thereof, shall call him and advertise him, that in any wise he
presume not to come to the Lord's Table, until he have openly
declared himself to have truly repented and amended his former
naughty life, that the Congregation may thereby be satisfied,
which before were offended; and that he have recompensed the
parties, to whom he hath done wrong; or at least declare himself
to be in full purpose so to do, as soon as he conveniently may_.

_The same order shall the Curate use with those betwixt whom he
perceiveth malice and hatred to reign; not suffering them to be
partakers of the Lord's Table, until he know them to be reconciled.
And if one of the parties so at variance be content to forgive
from the bottom of his heart all that the other hath trespassed
against him, and to make amends for that he himself hath offended;
and the other party will not be persuaded to a godly unity, but
remain still in his frowardness and malice: the Minister in that
case ought to admit the penitent person to the holy Communion, and
not him that is obstinate. Provided that every Minister so repelling
any, as is specified in this, or the next precedent Paragraph of
this Rubric, shall be obliged to give an account of the same to
the Ordinary within fourteen days after at the farthest. And the
Ordinary shall proceed against the offending person according to
the Canon_.

_The Table at the Communion time having a fair white linen cloth
upon it, shall stand in the body of the Church, or in the Chancel,
where Morning and Evening Prayer are appointed to be said. And the
Priest standing at the north side of the Table shall say the Lord's
Prayer with the Collect following, the people kneeling_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_The Collect_.

Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known,
and from whom no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our
hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly
love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy Name; through Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Priest, turning to the people, rehearse distinctly
all the TEN COMMANDMENTS: and the people still kneeling shall after
every Commandment ask God mercy for their transgression thereof for
the time past, and grace to keep the same for the time to come, as
followeth_.

_Minister_.

God spake these words, and said; I am the Lord thy God: Thou
shalt have none other gods but me.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor
the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth
beneath, or in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down
to them, nor worship them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous
God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shew mercy
unto thousands in them that love me and keep my commandments.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in
vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless, that taketh his
Name in vain.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Six
days shalt thou labour, and do all that thou hast to do; but the
seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt
do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy
man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger
that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and
hallowed it.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may
be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt do no murder.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt not steal.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to
keep this law.

_Minister_. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his servant, nor his
maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.

_People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and write all these thy laws
in our hearts, we beseech thee.

| _There may be substituted for_ The Ten Commandments (_which,
| however_, _shall always be said at least once a month_) The
| Summary of the Law, _as enunciated by our Lord:_
|
| Our Lord Jesus Christ said: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God
| is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
| heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all
| thy strength: This is the first commandment. And the second is
| like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:
| there is none other commandment greater than these.
|
| On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.
|
| _People_. Lord, have mercy upon us, and write these thy laws
| in our hearts, we beseech thee.

_Then shall follow one of these two Collects for the King, the
Priest standing as before, and saying_,

Let us pray.

Almighty God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and power infinite:
Have mercy upon the whole Church; and so rule the heart of thy
chosen servant _GEORGE_, our King and Governor, that he (knowing
whose minister he is) may above all things seek thy honour and
glory: and that we and all his subjects (duly considering whose
authority he hath) may faithfully serve, honour, and humbly
obey him, in thee, and for thee, according to thy blessed Word
and ordinance; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and
the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth, ever one God, world without
end. _Amen_.

_Or_,

Almighty and everlasting God, we are taught by thy holy Word,
that the hearts of Kings are in thy rule and governance, and that
thou dost dispose and turn them as it seemeth best to thy godly
wisdom: We humbly beseech thee so to dispose and govern the heart
of _GEORGE_ thy servant, our King and Governor, that in all his
thoughts, words, and works, he may ever seek thy honour and
glory, and study to preserve thy people committed to his charge,
in wealth, peace and godliness: Grant this, O merciful Father,
for thy dear Son's sake, Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

| _The Collects for the King may be omitted_.

_Then shall be said the Collect of the day. And immediately after
the Collect the Priest shall read the Epistle, saying_, The
Epistle [_or_, The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle]
is written in the------Chapter of------beginning at the------Verse.
_And the Epistle ended, he shall say_, Here endeth the Epistle. _Then
shall he read the Gospel_ (_the people all standing up_) _saying_,
The holy Gospel is written in the------Chapter of------beginning at
the------Verse.

| _When the Minister announces the Gospel for the day, the people_
| _standing up may devoutly say or sing_
|
| Glory be to thee, O Lord;
|
| _and after the Gospel the people may in like manner say or sing_
|
| Thanks be to thee, O Lord, for this thy glorious Gospel.

_And the Gospel ended, shall be sung or said the Creed following,
the people still standing as before_.

I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth, And of all things visible and invisible:

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,
Begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of
Light, Very God of very God, Begotten, not made, Being of one
substance with the Father, By whom all things were made: Who for
us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, And was
incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, And was made man,
And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered
and was buried, And the third day he rose again according to the
Scriptures, And ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand
of the Father. And he shall come again with glory to judge both the
quick and the dead: Whose kingdom shall have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Lord and giver of life, Who
proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Who with the Father and
the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the
Prophets. And I believe one Catholic and Apostolic Church. I
acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. And I look for
the Resurrection of the dead, And the life of the world to come.
Amen.

_Then the Curate shall declare unto the people what Holy-days, or
Fasting-days, are in the week following to be observed. And then
also_ (_if occasion be_) _shall notice be given of the Communion;
and Briefs, Citations, and Excommunications read. And nothing shall
be proclaimed or published in the Church during the time of Divine
Service, but by the Minister: nor by him any thing but what is
prescribed in the Rules of this Book, or enjoined by the King, or
by the Ordinary of the place_.

_Then shall follow the Sermon, or one of the Homilies already set
forth, or hereafter to be set forth, by authority_.

_Then shall the Priest return to the Lord's Table, and begin the
Offertory, saying one or more of these Sentences following, as he
thinketh most convenient in his discretion_.

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. _St Matth_. v.

Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon the earth; where the rust
and moth doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven; where neither rust
nor moth doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and
steal. _St Matth_. vi.

Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do unto
them; for this is the Law and the Prophets. _St Matth_. vii.

Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which
is in heaven. _St Matth_. vii.

Zacchaeus stood forth, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the
half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have done any wrong
to any man, I restore four-fold. _St Luke_ xix.

Who goeth a warfare at any time of his own cost? who planteth a
vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a
flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 1 _Cor_. ix.

If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter
if we shall reap your worldly things? 1 _Cor_. ix.

Do ye not know that they who minister about holy things live of
the sacrifice; and they who wait at the altar are partakers with
the altar? Even so hath the Lord also ordained, that they who
preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel. 1 _Cor_. ix.

He that soweth little shall reap little; and he that soweth
plenteously shall reap plenteously. Let every man do according as
he is disposed in his heart, not grudging, or of necessity; for
God loveth a cheerful giver. 2 _Cor_. ix.

Let him that is taught in the word minister unto him that teacheth,
in all good things. Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for
whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap. _Gal_. vi.

While we have time, let us do good unto all men; and specially unto
them that are of the household of faith. _Gal_. vi.

Godliness is great riches, if a man be content with that he hath:
for we brought nothing into the world, neither may we carry any
thing out. 1 _Tim_. vi.

Charge them who are rich in this world, that they be ready to
give, and glad to distribute; laying up in store for themselves a
good foundation against the time to come, that they may attain
eternal life. 1 _Tim_. vi.

God is not unrighteous, that he will forget your works, and labour
that proceedeth of love; which love ye have shewed for his name's
sake, who have ministered unto the saints, and yet do minister.
_Hebr_. vi.

To do good and to distribute forget not; for with such sacrifices
God is pleased. _Hebr_. xiii.

Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and
shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God
in him? 1 _St John_ iii.

Give alms of thy goods, and never turn thy face from any poor man;
and then the face of the Lord shall not be turned away from thee.
_Tobit_ iv.

Be merciful after thy power. If thou hast much, give plenteously;
if thou hast little, do thy diligence gladly to give of that little;
for so gatherest thou thyself a good reward in the day of necessity.
_Tobit_ iv.

He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord: and look,
what he layeth out, it shall be paid him again. _Prov_. xix.

Blessed be the man that provideth for the sick and needy: the Lord
shall deliver him in the time of trouble. _Psal_. xli.

| Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
| blessed to give than to receive. _Acts_ xx.

_Whilst these Sentences are in reading, the Deacons, Church-wardens,
or other fit person appointed for that purpose, shall receive the
Alms for the Poor, and other devotions of the people, in a decent
bason to be provided by the Parish for that purpose; and reverently
bring it to the Priest, who shall humbly present and place it upon
the holy Table_.

_And when there is a Communion, the Priest shall then place upon
the Table so much Bread and Wine as he shall think sufficient_.

_After offering the Elements_.

| Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
| and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven
| and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou
| art exalted as head above all. All things come of thee and of
| thine own have we given thee. 1 _Chron_. xxix. 11, 14.

_After which done, the Priest shall say_,

Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here
in earth.

Almighty and everliving God, who by thy holy Apostle hast taught
us to make prayers and supplications, and to give thanks, for all
men: We humbly beseech thee most * mercifully [_to accept our alms
and oblations, and_] to receive these our prayers, which we offer
unto thy Divine Majesty; beseeching thee to inspire continually
the universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity, and concord:
And grant, that all they that do confess thy holy Name may agree in
the truth of thy holy Word, and live in unity, and godly love. We
beseech thee also to save and defend all Christian Kings, Princes,
and Governors; and specially thy servant _GEORGE_ our King; that
under him we may be godly and quietly governed: And grant unto his
whole Council, and to all that are put in authority under him, that
they may truly and indifferently minister justice, to the punishment
of wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion,
and virtue. Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops and
Curates, that they may both by their life and doctrine set forth
thy true and lively Word, and rightly and duly administer thy
holy Sacraments: And to all thy people give thy heavenly grace;
and specially to this congregation here present; that, with meek
heart and due reverence, they may hear, and receive thy holy Word;
truly serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of
their life. And we most humbly beseech thee of thy goodness, O
Lord, to comfort and succour all them, who in this transitory
life are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity.
And we also bless thy holy Name for all thy servants departed this
life in thy faith and fear; beseeching thee to give us grace so
to follow their good examples, that with them we may be partakers
of thy heavenly kingdom: Grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's
sake, our only Mediator and Advocate. _Amen_.

[Margin Note:] * _If there be no alms or oblations, then shall
the words_ [of accepting our alms and oblations] _be left out
unsaid_.

_When the Minister giveth warning for the Celebration of the
holy Communion, (which he shall always do upon the Sunday or
some Holy-day, immediately preceding,) after the Sermon or Homily
ended, he shall read this Exhortation following_.

Dearly beloved, on------day next I purpose, through God's
assistance, to administer to all such as shall be religiously
and devoutly disposed the most comfortable Sacrament of the Body
and Blood of Christ; to be by them received in remembrance of his
meritorious Cross and Passion, whereby alone we obtain remission
of our sins, and are made partakers of the kingdom of heaven.
Wherefore it is our duty to render most humble and hearty thanks
to Almighty God our heavenly Father, for that he hath given his
Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, not only to die for us, but also to
be our spiritual food and sustenance in that holy Sacrament. Which
being so divine and comfortable a thing to them who receive it
worthily, and so dangerous to them that will presume to receive
it unworthily; my duty is to exhort you in the mean season to
consider the dignity of that holy mystery, and the great peril of
the unworthy receiving thereof; and so to search and examine your
own consciences, and that not lightly, and after the manner of
dissemblers with God: but so that ye may come holy and clean to
such a heavenly Feast, in the marriage-garment required by God in
holy Scripture, and be received as worthy partakers of that holy
Table.

The way and means thereto is; First, to examine your lives and
conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever
ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will,
word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess
yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of
life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are not
only against God, but also against your neighbours; then ye shall
reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make restitution
and satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for
all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being
likewise ready to forgive others that have offended you, as you
would have forgiveness of your offences at God's hand; for otherwise
the receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing else but increase
your damnation*. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God,
an hinderer or slanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in
malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you of
your sins, or else come not to that holy Table; lest, after the
taking of that holy Sacrament, the devil enter into you, as he
entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring
you to destruction both of body and soul.

And because it is requisite, that no man should come to the holy
Communion, but with a full trust in God's mercy, and with a quiet
conscience; therefore if there be any of you, who by this means
cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further
comfort or counsel, let him come to me, or to some other discreet
and learned Minister of God's Word, and open his grief; that by
the ministry of God's holy Word he may receive the benefit of
absolution, together with ghostly counsel and advice, to the
quieting of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple and
doubtfulness.

| * _The word_ guilt _may be substituted for the word_ damnation.

_Or, in case he shall see the people negligent to come to the holy
Communion, instead of the former, he shall use this Exhortation_.

Dearly beloved brethren, on------I intend, by God's grace, to
celebrate the Lord's Supper: unto which, in God's behalf, I bid
you all that are here present; and beseech you, for the Lord
Jesus Christ's sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto,
being so lovingly called and bidden by God himself. Ye know how
grievous and unkind a thing it is, when a man hath prepared a
rich feast, decked his table with all kind of provision, so that
there lacketh nothing but the guests to sit down; and yet they
who are called (without any cause) most unthankfully refuse to
come. Which of you, in such a case would not be moved? Who would
not think a great injury and wrong done unto him? Wherefore, most
dearly beloved in Christ, take ye good heed, lest ye, withdrawing
yourselves from this holy Supper, provoke God's indignation against
you. It is an easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate,
because I am otherwise hindered with worldly business. But such
excuses are not so easily accepted and allowed before God. If any
man say, I am a grievous sinner, and therefore am afraid to come:
wherefore then do ye not repent and amend? When God calleth you,
are ye not ashamed to say ye will not come? When ye should return
to God, will ye excuse yourselves, and say ye are not ready?
Consider earnestly with yourselves how little such feigned excuses
will avail before God. They that refused the feast in the Gospel,
 because they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of
oxen, or because they were married, were not so excused, but
counted unworthy of the heavenly feast. I, for my part, shall
be ready; and, according to mine Office, I bid you in the Name of
God, I call you in Christ's behalf, I exhort you, as ye love your
own salvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion.
And as the Son of God did vouchsafe to yield up his soul by death
upon the Cross for your salvation; so it is your duty to receive
the Communion, in remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, as
he himself hath commanded: which if ye shall neglect to do, consider
with yourselves how great injury ye do unto God, and how sore
punishment hangeth over your heads for the same; when ye wilfully
abstain from the Lord's Table, and separate from your brethren,
who come to feed on the banquet of that most heavenly food. These
things if ye earnestly consider, ye will by God's grace return to
a better mind: for the obtaining whereof we shall not cease to
make our humble petitions unto Almighty God our heavenly Father.

_At the time of the Celebration of the Communion, the Communicants
being conveniently placed for the receiving of the holy Sacrament,
the Priest shall say this Exhortation_.

Dearly beloved in the Lord, ye that mind to come to the holy
Communion of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ, must
consider how Saint Paul exhorteth all persons diligently to try
and examine themselves, before they presume to eat of that Bread,
and drink of that Cup. For as the benefit is great, if with a true
penitent heart and lively faith we receive that holy Sacrament;
(for then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his
blood; then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we are one with
Christ, and Christ with us;) so is the danger great, if we receive
the same unworthily. For then we are guilty of the Body and Blood
of Christ our Saviour; we eat and drink our own damnation *, not
considering the Lord's Body; we kindle God's wrath against us; we
provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundry kinds
of death. Judge therefore yourselves, brethren, that ye be not
judged of the Lord; repent you truly for your sins past; have a
lively and stedfast faith in Christ our Saviour; amend your lives,
and be in perfect charity with all men; so shall ye be meet
partakers of those holy mysteries. And above all things ye must
give most humble and hearty thanks to God, the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the world by the death
and passion of our Saviour Christ, both God and man; who did humble
himself, even to the death upon the Cross, for us miserable
sinners, who lay in darkness and the shadow of death; that he
might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting
life. And to the end that we should alway remember the exceeding
great love of our Master and only Saviour Jesus Christ, thus
dying for us, and the innumerable benefits which by his precious
blood-shedding he hath obtained to us; he hath instituted and
ordained holy mysteries, as pledges of his love, and for a continual
remembrance of his death, to our great and endless comfort. To him
therefore, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, let us give (as we
are most bounden) continual thanks; submitting ourselves wholly to
his holy will and pleasure, and studying to serve him in true
holiness and righteousness all the days of our life. _Amen_.

| _The Exhortation when warning is given of holy Communion, and_
| _the Exhortation at the time of the Celebration_, Dearly beloved
| in the Lord, _may be omitted, unless on occasions when their use_
| _is directed by his Bishop_.
|
| _In the former the word_ guilt_ may be substituted for the word_
| damnation; * _in the latter the word_ judgement _may be_
| _substituted for_ damnation.

_Then shall the Priest say to them that come to receive the
holy Communion_,

Ye that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and are
in love and charity with your neighbours, and intend to lead a
new life, following the commandments of God, and walking from
henceforth in his holy ways: Draw near with faith, and take this
holy Sacrament to your comfort; and make your humble confession
to Almighty God, meekly kneeling upon your knees.

_Then shall this general Confession be made, in the name of all
those that are minded to receive the holy Communion, by one of
the Ministers; both he and all the people kneeling humbly upon
their knees and saying_,

Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all
things, Judge of all men: We acknowledge and bewail our manifold
sins and wickedness, Which we from time to time most grievously
have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against thy Divine
Majesty, Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against
us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these our
misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The burden
of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, Have mercy upon us,
most merciful Father; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
Forgive us all that is past; And grant that we may ever hereafter
Serve and please thee In newness of life, To the honour and glory
of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

_Then shall the Priest_ (_or the Bishop, being present_,) _stand
up, and turning himself to the people, pronounce this Absolution_.

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy hath
promised forgiveness of sins to all them that with hearty repentance
and true faith turn unto him; Have mercy upon you; pardon and
deliver you from all your sins; confirm and strengthen you in all
goodness; and bring you to everlasting life; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith unto all
that truly turn to him.

Come unto me all that travail and are heavy laden, and I will
refresh you. _St Matth_. xi. 28.

So God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, to
the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life. _St John_ iii. 16.

Hear also what Saint Paul saith.

This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. 1 _Tim_. i. 15.

Hear also what Saint John saith.

If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins. 1 _St John_
ii. 1.

_After which the Priest shall proceed, saying_,

Lift up your hearts.

 _Answer_. We lift them up unto the Lord.

_Priest_. Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.

_Answer_. It is meet and right so to do.

_Then shall the Priest turn to the Lord's Table, and say_,

It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at
all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord, Holy
Father, Almighty, Everlasting God.

[Margin Note:] _These words_ [Holy Father] _must be omitted on_
Trinity Sunday.

_Here shall follow the proper Preface, according to the time, if
there be any specially appointed: or else immediately shall
follow_,

Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company of
heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name; evermore praising
thee, and saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and
earth are full of thy glory: Glory be to thee, O Lord most High.
Amen.

Proper Prefaces.

_Upon_ Christmas Day, _and seven days after_.

Because thou didst give Jesus Christ thine only Son to be born as
at this time for us; who, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, was
made very man of the substance of the Virgin Mary his mother; and
that without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin. Therefore
with Angels, &c.

_Upon_ Easter Day, _and seven days after_.

But chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the glorious Resurrection
of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord: for he is the very Paschal Lamb,
which was offered for us, and hath taken away the sin of the world;
who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his rising to life
again hath restored to us everlasting life. Therefore with Angels,
&c.

_Upon_ Ascension Day, _and seven days after_.

Through thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who
after his most glorious Resurrection manifestly appeared to all
his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven to
prepare a place for us; that where he is, thither we might also
ascend, and reign with him in glory. Therefore with Angels, &c.

_Upon_ Whitsunday, _and six days after_.

Through Jesus Christ our Lord; according to whose most true
promise, the Holy Ghost came down as at this time from heaven
with a sudden great sound, as it had been a mighty wind, in the
likeness of fiery tongues, lighting upon the Apostles, to teach
them, and to lead them to all truth; giving them both the gift of
divers languages, and also boldness with fervent zeal constantly
to preach the Gospel unto all nations; whereby we have been
brought out of darkness and error into the clear light and true
knowledge of thee, and of thy Son Jesus Christ. Therefore with
Angels, &c.

_Upon the Feast of_ Trinity _only_.

Who art one God, one Lord; not one only Person, but three Persons
in one Substance. For that which we believe of the glory of the
Father, the same we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
without any difference or in equality. Therefore with Angels, &c.

| _The following_ ADDITIONAL PROPER PREFACES _may be said_:
| _Upon_ The Epiphany, _and seven days after_.
|
| Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, in substance of our mortal
| flesh, manifested forth his glory, that he might bring us out of
| darkness into his own marvellous light. Therefore, &c.
|
| _Upon_ The Purification.
|
| Because thy blessed Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, born of a
| woman, born under the Law, was, as on this day, presented in the
| Temple, and revealed to thy servants as a light to lighten the
| Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel. Therefore, &c.
|
| _Upon_ The Annunciation.
|
| Because thou didst give Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be born
| for us, who by the operation of the Holy Ghost, was made very
| man, of the substance of the blessed Virgin Mary his mother, and
| that without spot of sin, to make us clean from all sin.
| Therefore, &c.
|
| _Upon_ Feasts of Apostles and Evangelists, _except when the
| proper preface for any of the Great Festivals is appointed to
| be said_.
|
| Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who did vouchsafe to choose thy
| servant Saint _N_. [_or_ thy servants Saint _N_. and Saint _N_.]
| to be of the company of the Apostles [_or_ to be an Evangelist]
| by whose ministry thine elect might be gathered in from every
| nation, and thy Church instructed in the way that leadeth unto
| everlasting life. Therefore, &c.
|
| _Upon_ All Saints' Day.
|
| Who in the multitude of thy Saints hast compassed us about with
| so great a cloud of witnesses, to the end that we, rejoicing in
| their fellowship, may run with patience the race that is set
| before us, and together with them receive the crown of glory
| that fadeth not away. Therefore, &c.
|
| _At the_ Consecration of Bishops, _and_ Ordination of Priests
| and Deacons.
|
| Through Jesus Christ our Lord, the great Shepherd of the sheep,
| who, for the feeding and guidance of his flock, did appoint
| divers orders of ministers in his Church. Therefore, &c.
|
| _At the_ Dedication of a Church, _and_ Anniversary of the
| Dedication.
|
| Who in temples made with hands buildest up for thyself a
| spiritual temple made without hands. Therefore, &c.

_After each of which Prefaces shall immediately be sung or said_,

Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company of
heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious Name; evermore praising
thee, and saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and
earth are full of thy glory: Glory be to thee, O Lord most High.
Amen.

_Then shall the Priest, kneeling down at the Lord's Table, say
in the name of all them that shall receive the Communion this
Prayer following_.

We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord,
trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great
mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs
under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord, whose property is
always to have mercy: Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to
eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his
blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body, and
our souls washed through his most precious blood, and that we may
ever more dwell in him, and he in us. _Amen_.

_When the Priest, standing before the Table, hath so ordered the
Bread and Wine, that he may with the more readiness and decency
break the Bread before the people, and take the Cup into his
hands, he shall say the Prayer of Consecration, as followeth_.

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of thy tender mercy didst
give thine only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death upon the Cross
for our redemption; who made there (by his one oblation of himself
once offered) a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation,
and satisfaction, for the sins of the whole world; and did
institute, and in his holy Gospel command us to continue, a
perpetual memory of that his precious death, until his coming
again: Hear us, O merciful Father, we most humbly beseech thee;
and grant that we receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine,
according to thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy institution,
in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his
most blessed Body and Blood: who, in the same night that he was
betrayed, [a] took Bread; and, when he had given thanks, [b] he
brake it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take, eat; [c]
this is my Body which is given for you: Do this in remembrance
of me. Likewise after supper [d] he took the Cup; and, when he
had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all Of
this; for [e] this is my Blood of the New Testament, which is
shed for you and for many for the remission of sins: Do this, as
oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me. _Amen_.

[Margin Notes:] [a] _Here the Priest is to take the Paten into
his hands:_

[b] _And here to break the Bread:_

[c] _And here to lay his hand upon all the Bread_.

[d] _Here he is to take the Cup into his hand:_

[e] _And here to lay his hand upon every vessel_ (_be it Chalice
or Flagon_) _in which there is any Wine to be consecrated_.

_Then shall the Minister first receive the Communion in both kinds
himself, and then proceed to deliver the same to the Bishops,
Priests, and Deacons, in like manner, (if any be present,) and
after that to the people also in order, into their hands, all
meekly kneeling. And, when he delivereth the Bread to any one,
he shall say_,

The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was  given for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life: Take and eat
this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on him
in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving.

_And the Minister that delivereth the Cup to any one shall say_,

The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life: Drink this in
remembrance that Christ's Blood was shed for thee, and be thankful.

| _When it is thought desirable to shorten the words of_
| _administration on Christmas-day Easter-day, and Whitsunday, or_
| _on special occasions approved by the Bishop, or in the case_
| _of the pressure caused by large and unexpected numbers, the_
| _Priest, having first said the whole words of administration_
| (_in the singular number_) _once for all the communicants, may_
| _use the first half of each form in communicating individuals_.

_If the consecrated Bread or Wine be all spent before all have
communicated, the Priest is to consecrate more according to the
Form before prescribed: Beginning at_ [Our Saviour Christ in the
same night, &c.] _for the blessing of the Bread: and at_ [Likewise
after Supper, &c.] _for the blessing of the Cup_.

_When all have communicated, the Minister shall return to the
Lord's Table, and reverently place upon it what remaineth of
the consecrated Elements, covering the same with a fair linen
cloth_.

_Then shall the Priest say the Lord's Prayer, the people
repeating after him every petition_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we
forgive them that trespass against us; And lead us not into
temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.

_After shall be said as followeth_.

O Lord and heavenly Father, we thy humble servants entirely
desire thy fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most humbly beseeching
thee to grant, that by the merits and death of thy Son Jesus
Christ, and through faith in his blood, we and all thy whole
Church may obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits
of his passion. And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord,
ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and
lively sacrifice unto thee; humbly beseeching thee, that all we,
who are partakers of this holy Communion, may be fulfilled with
thy grace and heavenly benediction. And although we be unworthy,
through our manifold sins, to offer unto thee any sacrifice, yet
we beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service; not
weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences, through Jesus
Christ our Lord; by whom, and with whom, in the unity of the Holy
Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O Father Almighty, world
without end. _Amen_.

_Or this_.

Almighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee, for
that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who have duly received these
holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious Body
and Blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost assure us
thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and that we are
very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, which
is the blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs
through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most
precious death and passion of thy dear Son. Aid we most humbly
beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace,
that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good
works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus
Christ our Lord, to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all
honour and glory, world without end. _Amen_.

| _Both the post-communion prayers_ O Lord and heavenly Father,
| _and_ Almighty and everliving God, _maybe said in succession_
| _at the same service_.

_Then shall be said or sung_,

Glory be to God on high, and in earth peace, good will towards
men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify
thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God,
heavenly King, God the Father Almighty. O Lord, the only-begotten
Son, Jesu Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,
that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou
that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou
that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Thou
that sittest at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon
us.

For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O
Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God
the Father. Amen.

_Then the Priest_ (_or Bishop if he be present_) _shall let them
depart with this Blessing_.

The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your
hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord: And the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and
remain with you always. _Amen_.

_Collects to be said after the Offertory, when there is no
Communion, every such day one or more; and the same may be
said also, as often as occasion shall serve, after the Collects
either of Morning or Evening Prayer, Communion, or Litany, by
the discretion of the Minister_.

Assist us mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplications and
prayers, and dispose the way of thy servants towards the attainment
of everlasting salvation; that, among all the changes and chances
of this mortal life, they may ever be defended by thy most gracious
and ready help; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, in
the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that
through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be
preserved in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. _Amen_.

Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that the words, which we
have heard this day with our outward ears, may through thy grace
be so grafted inwardly in our hearts, that they may bring forth
in us the fruit of good living, to the honour and praise of thy
Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy most gracious
favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works, begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy
holy Name, and finally by thy mercy obtain everlasting life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, who knowest our
necessities before we ask, and our ignorance in asking: We
beseech thee to have compassion upon our infirmities; and those
things, which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our
blindness we cannot ask, vouchsafe to give us for the worthiness
of thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Almighty God, who hast promised to hear the petitions of them
that ask in thy Son's Name: We beseech thee mercifully to incline
thine ears to us that have made now our prayers and supplications
unto thee; and grant that those things, which we have faithfully
asked according to thy will, may effectually be obtained, to the
relief of our necessity, and to the setting forth of thy glory;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.


| PRAYERS FOR CERTAIN FESTIVALS AND SEASONS
|
| _Which may be said immediately before the Blessing at holy_
| _Communion, or before the conclusion of other services_.
|
| _Advent_.
|
| Grant, O almighty God, that as thy blessed Son Jesus Christ at
| his first advent came to seek and to save that which was lost, so
| at his second and glorious appearing he may find in us the fruits
| of the redemption which he wrought, who liveth and reigneth, with
| thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.
|
| _Christmas-day, and seven days after_.
|
| O God, who hast given us grace at this time to celebrate the
| birth of our Saviour, Jesus Christ: We laud and magnify thy
| glorious Name for the countless blessings which he hath brought
| unto us; and we beseech thee to grant that we may ever set forth
| thy praise in joyful obedience to thy will; through the same
| Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| _Epiphany, and seven days after_.
|
| Almighty God, who at the baptism of thy blessed Son Jesus Christ
| in the river Jordan didst manifest his glorious Godhead: Grant,
| we beseech thee, that the brightness of his presence may shine
| in our hearts, and his glory be set forth in our lives; through
| the same Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
|_Easter-day, and seven days after_.
|
| O Lord God Almighty, whose blessed Son, our Saviour, Jesus
| Christ, did on the third day rise triumphant over death: Raise
| us, we beseech thee, from the death of sin unto the life of
| righteousness, that we may seek those things which are above,
| where he sitteth on thy right hand in glory. And this we beg for
| the sake of the same, thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| _Ascension-day, and seven days after_.
|
| Almighty God, whose blessed Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ
| ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things:
| Mercifully give us faith to perceive that according to his
| promise he abideth with his Church on earth, even unto the end of
| the world; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| _Whitsunday, and six days after_.
|
| O almighty God, who on the day of Pentecost didst send the Holy
| Ghost the Comforter to abide in thy Church unto the end: Bestow
| upon us and all thy faithful people his manifold gifts of grace,
| that with minds enlightened by his truth, and hearts purified by
| his presence, we may day by day be strengthened with power in
| the inward man; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and
| the same Spirit liveth and reigneth, one God, world without end.
| _Amen_.
|
| _Trinity Sunday_.
|
| O Lord God Almighty, Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the mysteries
| of whose being are unsearchable: Accept, we beseech thee, our
| praises for the revelation which thou hast made of thyself,
| Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons, and one God; and
| mercifully grant, that ever holding fast this faith we may
| magnify thy glorious Name; who livest and reignest, one God,
| world without end. _Amen_.
|
| _Two other prayers_.
|
| O almighty Father, wellspring of life to all things that have
| being, from amid the unwearied praises of Cherubim and Seraphim
| who stand about thy throne of light which no man can approach
| unto, give ear, we humbly beseech thee, to the supplications of
| thy people who put their sure trust in thy mercy, through Jesus
| Christ our Lord. _Amen_. (_From the_ Book of Deer.)
|
| O Lord Jesus Christ, before whose judgement-seat we must all
| appear and give account of the things done in the body: Grant,
| we beseech thee, that when the books are opened in that day, the
| faces of thy servants may not be ashamed, through thy merits, O
| blessed Saviour, who livest and reignest with the Father and the
| Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_. [_From the_
| Altus _of_ St Columba.]

_Upon the Sundays and other Holy-days_ (_if there be no Communion_)
_shall be said all that is appointed at the Communion, until the
end of the general Prayer_ [For the whole state of Christ's Church
militant here in earth] _together with one or more of these
Collects last before rehearsed, concluding with the Blessing_.

_And there shall be no Celebration of the Lord's Supper, except
there be a convenient number to communicate with the Priest,
according to his discretion_.

_And if there be not above twenty persons in the Parish of
discretion to receive the Communion: yet there shall be no
Communion, except four_ (_or three at the least_) _communicate
with the Priest_.

_And in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, and Colleges, where
there are many Priests and Deacons, they shall all receive the
Communion with the Priest every Sunday at the least, except they
have a reasonable cause to the contrary_.

_And to take away all occasion of dissension, and superstition,
which any person hath or might have concerning the Bread and Wine,
it shall suffice that the Bread be such as is usual to be eaten;
but the best and purest Wheat Bread that conveniently may be
gotten_.

_And if any of the Bread and Wine remain unconsecrated, the Curate
shall have it to his own use: but if any remain of that which was
consecrated, it shall not be carried out of the Church, but the
Priest, and such other of the Communicants as he shall then call
unto him, shall, immediately after the Blessing, reverently eat
and drink the same_.

_The Bread and Wine for the Communion shall be provided by the
Curate, and the Church-wardens at the charges of the Parish_.

_And note, that every Parishioner shall communicate at the least
three times in the year, of which Easter to be one. And yearly at
Easter every Parishioner shall reckon with the Parson, Vicar, or
Curate, or his or their Deputy or Deputies; and pay to them or him
all Ecclesiastical Duties, accustomably due, then and at that time
to be paid_.

_After the Divine Service ended, the money given at the Offertory
shall be disposed of to such pious and charitable uses, as the
Minister and Church-wardens shall think fit. Wherein if they
disagree, it shall be disposed of as the Ordinary shall appoint_.

_Whereas it is ordained in this office for the Administration of
the Lord's Supper, that the Communicants should receive the same
kneeling; (which order is well meant, for a signification of our
humble and grateful acknowledgement of the benefits of Christ
therein given to all worthy Receivers, and for the avoiding of
such profanation and disorder in the holy Communion, as might
otherwise ensue;) yet, lest the same kneeling should by any
persons, either out of ignorance and infirmity, or out of malice
and obstinacy, be misconstrued and depraved: It is here declared,
that thereby no Adoration is intended, or ought to be done, either
unto the Sacramental Bread or Wine there bodily received, or unto
any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood. For the
Sacramental Bread and Wine remain still in their very natural
substances, and therefore may not be adored;_ (_for that were
Idolatry, to be abhorred of all faithful Christians;_) _and the
natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ are in Heaven, and
not here; it being against the truth of Christ's natural Body to
be at one time in more places than one_.




THE MINISTRATION OF

PUBLIC BAPTISM OF INFANTS,

TO BE USED IN THE CHURCH


_The people are to be admonished, that it is most convenient that
Baptism should not be administered but upon Sundays, and other
Holy-days, when the most number of people come together; as well
for that the Congregation there present may testify the receiving
of them that be newly baptized into the number of Christ's Church;
as also because in the Baptism of Infants every man present may
be put in remembrance of his own profession made to God in his
Baptism. For which cause also it is expedient that Baptism be
ministered in the vulgar tongue. Nevertheless_, (_if necessity so
require_,) _children may be baptized upon any other day_.

_The public office for the ministration of Baptism of infants may
be used as a separate service, and such service may be concluded
with the Blessing_.

_And note, that there shall be for every male child to be baptized
two Godfathers and one Godmother; and for every female, one
Godfather and two Godmothers_.

_When there are children to be baptized, the parents shall give
knowledge thereof over night, or in the morning before the beginning
of Morning Prayer, to the Curate. And then the Godfathers and
Godmothers and the people with the children must be ready at the
Font, either immediately after the last Lesson at Morning Prayer,
or else immediately after the last Lesson at Evening Prayer, as
the Curate by his discretion shall appoint. And the Priest coming
to the Font_, (_which is then to be filled with pure Water,_) _and
standing there, shall say_, Hath this Child been already baptized,
or no? _If they answer_, No: _then shall the Priest proceed as
followeth_.

Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin,
and that our Saviour Christ saith, none can enter into the kingdom
of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of Water and of the
Holy Ghost: I beseech you to call upon God the Father, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous mercy he will grant to
_this Child_ that thing which by nature _he_ cannot have; that _he_
may be baptized with Water and the Holy Ghost, and received into
Christ's holy Church, and be made _a lively member_ of the same.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Let us pray.

Almighty and everlasting God, who of thy great mercy didst save
Noah and his family in the ark from perishing by water; and also
didst safely lead the children of Israel thy people through the
Red Sea, figuring thereby thy holy Baptism; and by the Baptism of
thy well-beloved Son Jesus Christ, in the river Jordan, didst
sanctify water to the mystical washing away of sin: We beseech
thee, for thine infinite mercies, that thou wilt mercifully look
upon _this Child_, wash _him_ and sanctify _him_ with the Holy
Ghost; that _he_, being delivered from thy wrath, may be received
into the ark of Christ's Church; and being stedfast in faith,
joyful through hope, and rooted in charity, may so pass the waves
of this troublesome world, that finally _he_ may come to the land
of everlasting life, there to reign with thee world without end,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Almighty and immortal God, the aid of all that need, the helper of
all that flee to thee for succour, the life of them that believe,
and the resurrection of the dead: We call upon thee for _this
Infant_, that _he_, coming to thy holy Baptism, may receive
remission of _his_ sins by spiritual regeneration. Receive _him_,
O Lord, as thou hast promised by thy well-beloved Son, saying, Ask,
and ye shall have; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be
opened unto you: So give now unto us that ask; let us that seek
find; open the gate unto us that knock; that _this Infant_ may
enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly washing, and may
come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised by Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

| _In the ministration of Baptism of infants it may suffice to say
one or other of the two opening prayers_, Almighty and everlasting
God, _or_ Almighty and immortal God.

_Then shall the people stand up, and the Priest shall say_,

Hear the words of the Gospel, written by Saint Mark in the tenth
chapter at the thirteenth verse.

They brought young children to Christ, that he should touch them;
and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus
saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the
kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive
the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
blessed them.

_After the Gospel is read, the Minister shall make this brief
exhortation upon the words of the Gospel_.

Beloved, ye hear in this Gospel the words of our Saviour Christ,
that he commanded the children to be brought unto him; how he
blamed those that would have kept them from him; how he exhorteth
all men to follow their innocency. Ye perceive how by his outward
gesture and deed he declared his good will toward them; for he
embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them, and blessed
them. Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly believe, that he will
likewise favourably receive _this_ present _Infant_; that he will
embrace _him_ with the arms of his mercy; that he will give unto
_him_ the blessing of eternal life, and make _him_ partaker of his
everlasting kingdom. Wherefore we being thus persuaded of the good
will of our heavenly Father towards _this Infant_, declared by his
Son Jesus Christ; and nothing doubting but that he favourably
alloweth this charitable work of ours in bringing _this Infant_ to
his holy Baptism; let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto
him, and say,

Almighty and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble
thanks that thou hast vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of
thy grace and faith in thee: Increase this knowledge, and confirm
this faith in us evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to _this Infant_,
that _he_ may be born again, and be made _an heir_ of everlasting
salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Priest speak unto the Godfathers and Godmothers
on this wise_.

Dearly beloved, ye have brought _this Child_ here to be baptized;
ye have prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to receive
_him_, to release _him_ of _his_ sins, to sanctify _him_ with the
Holy Ghost, to give _him_ the kingdom of heaven and everlasting
life. Ye have heard also that our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised
in his Gospel, to grant all these things that ye have prayed for:
which promise he, for his part, will most surely keep and perform.
Wherefore, after this promise made by Christ, _this Infant_ must
also faithfully, for _his_ part, promise by you that are _his_
sureties, (until _he_ come of age to take it upon _himself_,) that
_he_ will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly
believe God's holy Word, and obediently keep his commandments.

I demand therefore,

Dost thou, in the name of this Child, renounce the devil and all
his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous
desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that
thou wilt not follow nor be led by them?

_Answer_. I renounce them all.

_Minister_.

Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth?

And in Jesus Christ his only-begotten Son our Lord? And that he
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; that he
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried;
that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third day;
that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God
the Father Almighty; and from thence shall come again at the end
of the world, to judge the quick and the dead?

And dost thou believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Catholic Church;
the Communion of Saints; the Remission of sins; the Resurrection of
the flesh; and everlasting life after death? _Answer_. All this I
stedfastly believe.

_Minister_.

Wilt thou be baptized in this faith?

_Answer_. That is my desire.

_Minister_.

Wilt thou then obediently keep God's holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same all the days of thy life?

_Answer_. I will.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

O merciful God, grant that the old Adam in _this Child_ may be so
buried, that the new man may be raised up in _him_. _Amen_.

Grant that all carnal affections may die in _him_, and that all
things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow in _him_. _Amen_.

Grant that _he_ may have power and strength, to have victory, and
to triumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh. _Amen_.

Grant that whosoever is here dedicated to thee by our office and
ministry may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly
rewarded, through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who dost live,
and govern all things, world without end. _Amen_.

Almighty everliving God, whose most dearly beloved Son Jesus
Christ, for the forgiveness of our sins, did shed out of his most
precious side both water and blood; and gave commandment to his
disciples, that they should go teach all nations, and baptize them
in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Regard, we beseech thee, the supplications of thy Congregation;
sanctify this Water to the mystical washing away of sin; and grant
that _this Child_, now to be baptized therein, may receive the
fulness of thy grace, and ever remain in the number of thy faithful
and elect children; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then the Priest shall take the Child into his hands, and shall
say to the Godfathers and Godmothers_, Name this Child. _And then
naming it after them_ (_if they shall certify him that the Child
may well endure it_) _he shall dip it in the Water discreetly and
warily, saying_,

_N_. I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_But if they certify that the Child is weak, it shall suffice to
pour Water upon it, saying the foresaid words_,

_N_. I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_Then the Priest shall say_,

We receive this Child into the Congregation Of Christ's flock, *
and do sign him with the sign of the Cross, in token that hereafter
_he_ shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified,
and manfully to fight under his banner against sin, the world, and
the devil, and to continue Christ's faithful soldier and servant
unto his life's end. Amen.

[Margin Note:] * _Here the Priest shall make a Cross upon the
Child's forehead_.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that _this Child_ is regenerate
and grafted into the body of Christ's Church, let us give thanks
unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one accord make our
prayers unto him, that _this Child_ may lead the rest of _his_ life
according to this beginning.

_Then shall be said, all kneeling_,

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, But
deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath
pleased thee to regenerate _this Infant_ with thy Holy Spirit, to
receive _him_ for thine own _Child_ by adoption, and to incorporate
_him_ into thy holy Church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant
that _he_ being dead unto sin, and living unto righteousness, and
being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old man, and
utterly abolish the whole body of sin; and that, as _he is_ made
_partaker_ of the death of thy Son, _he_ may also be _partaker_ of
his resurrection; so that finally, with the residue of thy holy
Church, _he_ may be _an inheritor_ of thine everlasting kingdom;
through Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then, all standing up, the Priest shall say to the Godfathers and
Godmothers this exhortation following_.

Forasmuch as _this Child hath_ promised by you _his_ sureties to
renounce the devil and all his works, to believe in God, and to
serve him: Ye must remember, that it is your parts and duties to
see that _this Infant_ be taught, so soon as _he_ shall be able to
learn, what a solemn vow, promise and profession _he hath_ here
made by you. And that _he_ may know these things the better, ye
shall call upon _him_ to hear sermons; and chiefly ye shall provide
that _he_ may learn the Creed, the Lord's Prayer and the Ten
Commandments in the vulgar tongue, and all other things which a
Christian ought to know and believe to his soul's health; and that
_this Child_ may be virtuously brought up to lead a godly and a
Christian life; remembering always, that Baptism doth represent
unto us our profession; which is, to follow the example of our
Saviour Christ, and to be made like unto him; that as he died and
rose again for us, so should we, who are baptized, die from sin and
rise again unto righteousness, continually mortifying all our evil
and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and
godliness of living.

_Then shall he add and say_,

Ye are to take care that _this Child_ be brought to the Bishop to
be confirmed by him, so soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord's
Prayer and the Ten Commandments in the vulgar tongue, and be
further instructed in the Church Catechism set forth for that
purpose.

_It is certain by God's Word, that children which are baptized,
dying before they commit actual sin, are undoubtedly saved_.

_To take away all scruple concerning the use of the sign of the
Cross in Baptism; the true explication thereof, and the just
reasons for the retaining of it, may be seen in the xxxth Canon,
first published in the year MDCIV_.




THE MINISTRATION OF

PRIVATE BAPTISM OF CHILDREN

IN HOUSES


_The Curates of every Parish shall often admonish the people, that
they defer not the Baptism of their children longer than the first
or second Sunday next after their birth, or other Holy-day falling
between, unless upon a great and reasonable cause, to be approved
by the Curate_.

_And also they shall warn them, that without like great cause and
necessity they profuse not their children to be baptized at home
in their houses. But when need shall compel them so to do, then
Baptism shall be administered on this fashion_.

_First let the Minister of the Parish_ (_or, in his absence, any
other lawful Minister that can be procured_) _with them that are
present call upon God, and say the Lord's Prayer, and so many of
the Collects appointed to be said before in the form of Public
Baptism, as the time and present exigence will suffer. And then,
the child being named by some one that is present, the Minister
shall pour Water upon it, saying these words_;

_N_. I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_Then, all kneeling down, the Minister shall give thanks unto God,
and say_,

We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath
pleased thee to regenerate this Infant with thy Holy Spirit, to
receive _him_ for thine own Child by adoption, and to incorporate
_him_ into thy holy Church. And we humbly beseech thee to grant,
that as _he_ is now made partaker of the death of thy Son, so _he_
may be also of his resurrection; and that finally, with the residue
of thy Saints, _he_ may inherit thine everlasting kingdom; through
the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_And let them not doubt, but that the Child so baptized is lawfully
and sufficiently baptized, and ought not to be baptized again. Yet
nevertheless, if the Child which is after this sort baptized do
afterward live, it is expedient that it be brought into the Church,
to the intent that, if the Minister of the same Parish did himself
baptize that Child, the Congregation may be certified of the true
form of Baptism, by him privately before used. In which case he
shall say thus_,

I certify you, that according to the due and prescribed Order of
the Church, at such a time, and at such a place, before divers
witnesses, I baptized this Child.

_But if the Child were baptized by any other lawful Minister, then
the Minister of the Parish, where the Child was born or christened,
shall examine and try whether the Child be lawfully baptized, or
no. In which case, if those that bring any Child to the Church do
answer that the same Child is already baptized, then shall the
Minister examine them further, saying_,

By whom was this Child baptized? Who was present when this Child
was baptized?

Because some things essential to this Sacrament may happen to be
omitted through fear or haste, in such times of extremity;
therefore I demand further of you,

With what matter was this Child baptized? With what words was this
Child baptized?

_And if the Minister shall find by the answers of such as bring
the Child, that all things were done as they ought to be; then
shall not he christen the Child again, but shall receive him as one
of the flock of true Christian people, saying thus_,

I certify you, that in this case all is well done, and according
unto due order, concerning the baptizing of this Child; who being
born in original sin, and in the wrath of God, is now, by the
laver of Regeneration in Baptism, received into the number of the
children of God and heirs of everlasting life: for our Lord Jesus
Christ doth not deny his grace and mercy unto such infants, but
most lovingly doth call them unto him, as the holy Gospel doth
witness to our comfort on this wise.

St Mark x. 13.

They brought young children to Christ, that he should touch them;
and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus
saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the
little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such
is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter
therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them,
and blessed them.

_After the Gospel is read, the Minister shall make this brief
exhortation upon the words of the Gospel_.

Beloved, ye hear in this Gospel the words  of our Saviour Christ,
that he commanded the children to be brought unto him; how he
blamed those that would have kept them from him; how he exhorted
all men to follow their innocency. Ye perceive how by his outward
gesture and deed he declared his good will toward them; for he
embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them, and blessed
them. Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly believe, that he hath
likewise favourably received this present Infant; that he hath
embraced him with the arms of his mercy; and (as he hath promised
in his holy Word) will give unto him the blessing of eternal life,
and make him partaker of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore, we
being thus persuaded of the good will of our heavenly Father,
declared by his Son Jesus Christ, towards this Infant, let us
faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and say the Prayer
which the Lord himself taught us:

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Almighty and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble
thanks that thou hast vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy
grace and faith in thee: Increase this knowledge, and confirm this
faith in us evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to this Infant, that
_he_, being born again, and being made an heir of everlasting
salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, may continue thy servant,
and attain thy promise; through the same our Lord Jesus Christ thy
Son, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, now
and for ever. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Priest demand the Name of the Child; which by the
Godfathers and Godmothers pronounced, the Minister shall say_,

Dost thou, in the name of this Child, renounce the devil and all
his works, the vain pomp and glory of this world, with all covetous
desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that
thou wilt not follow nor be led by them?

_Answer_. I renounce them all.

_Minister_.

Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth?

And in Jesus Christ his only-begotten Son our Lord? And that he was
conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; that he
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried;
that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third
day; that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand
of God the Father Almighty; and from thence shall come again at the
end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead?

And dost thou believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Catholic Church;
the Communion of Saints; the Remission of sins; the Resurrection
of the flesh; and everlasting life after death?

_Answer_. All this I stedfastly believe.

_Minister_.

Wilt thou then obediently keep God's holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same all the days of thy life?

_Answer_. I will.

_Then the Priest shall say_,

We receive this Child into the Congregation of Christ's flock,
and do * sign _him_ with the Sign Of Cross, in token that hereafter
_he_ shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified,
and manfully to fight under his banner against sin, the world, and
the devil, and to continue Christ's faithful soldier and servant
unto _his_ life's end. Amen.

[Margin Note:] * _The Priest shall make a Cross upon the Child's
forehead_.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this Child is by Baptism
regenerate and grafted into the body of Christ's Church, let us
give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one
accord make our prayers unto him, that _he_ may lead the rest of
_his_ life according to this beginning.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

We yield thee most hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it
hath pleased thee to regenerate this Infant with thy Holy Spirit,
to receive _him_ for thine own Child by adoption, and to incorporate
_him_ into thy holy Church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant
that _he_ being dead unto sin, and living unto righteousness, and
being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old man,
and utterly abolish the whole body of sin; and that, as _he_ is
made partaker of the death of thy Son, he may also be partaker of
his resurrection; so that finally, with the residue of thy holy
Church, he may be an inheritor of thine everlasting kingdom; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then, all standing up, the Minister shall make this exhortation
to the Godfathers and Godmothers_.

Forasmuch as this Child hath promised by you _his_ sureties to
renounce the devil and all his works, to believe in God, and to
serve him: Ye must remember, that it is your parts and duties to
see that this Infant be taught, so soon as _he_ shall be able to

righteousness, continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt
affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and godliness of
living.

_But if they which bring the Infant to the Church do make such
uncertain answers to the Priest's questions, as that it cannot
appear that the Child was baptized with water, In the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,_ (_which are
essential parts of Baptism,_) _then let the Priest baptize it in
the form before appointed for Public Baptism of Infants: Saving
that at the dipping of the Child in the Font, he shall use this
form of words_.

If thou art not already baptized, _N_. I baptize thee in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.




THE MINISTRATION OF

BAPTISM TO SUCH AS ARE

OF RIPER YEARS,

AND ABLE TO ANSWER FOR THEMSELVES


_When any such persons, as are of riper years, are to be baptized,
timely notice shall be given to the Bishop, or whom he shall
appoint for that purpose, a week before at the least, by the
Parents, or some other discreet persons; that so due care may
be taken for their examination, whether they be sufficiently
instructed in the principles of the Christian Religion; and that
they may be exhorted to prepare themselves with Prayers and Fasting
for the receiving of this holy Sacrament_.

_And if they shall be found fit, then the Godfathers and
Godmothers_ (_the people being assembled upon the Sunday or
Holy-day appointed_) _shall be ready to present them at the Font
immediately after the second Lesson, either at Morning or Evening
Prayer, as the Curate in his discretion shall think fit_.

| _The public office for the ministration of Baptism of such as
be of riper_ _years may be used as a separate service, and such
service may be_ _concluded with the Blessing_.

_And standing there, the Priest shall ask, whether any of the
persons here presented be baptized, or no: If they shall answer_,
No; _then shall the Priest say thus_,

Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in
sin, (and that which is born of the flesh is flesh,) and they that
are in the flesh cannot please God, but live in sin, committing
many actual transgressions; and that our Saviour Christ saith, none
can enter into the kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born
anew of water and of the Holy Ghost; I beseech you to call upon God
the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous
goodness he will grant to these persons that which by nature they
cannot have; that they may be baptized with water and the Holy
Ghost, and received into Christ's holy Church, and be made lively
members of the same.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Let us pray.

(_And here all the Congregation shall kneel_.)

Almighty and everlasting God, who of thy great mercy didst save
Noah and his family in the ark from perishing by water; and also
didst safely lead the children of Israel thy people through the
Red Sea, figuring thereby thy holy Baptism; and by the Baptism of
thy well-beloved Son Jesus Christ, in the river Jordan, didst
sanctify the element of water to the mystical washing away of
sin: We beseech thee, for thine infinite mercies, that thou wilt
mercifully look upon _these_ thy _servants_; wash _them_ and
sanctify _them_ with the Holy Ghost; that _they_, being delivered
from thy wrath, may be received into the ark of Christ's Church;
and being stedfast in faith, joyful through hope, and rooted in
charity, may so pass the waves of this troublesome world, that
finally _they_ may come to the land of everlasting life, there to
reign with thee world without end, through Jesus Christ our Lord
_Amen_.

Almighty and immortal God, the aid of all that need, the helper of
all that flee to thee for succour, the life of them that believe,
and the resurrection of the dead: We call upon thee for _these
persons_, that _they_, coming to thy holy Baptism, may receive
remission of _their_ sins by spiritual regeneration. Receive _them_,
O Lord: and as thou hast promised by thy well-beloved Son, saying,
Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you: So give now unto us that ask; let us that
seek find; open the gate unto us that knock; that _these persons_
may enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly washing, and
may come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised by Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

| _In the ministration of Baptism of such as be of riper years it
may suffice to say one or other of the two opening prayers_,
Almighty and everlasting God, _or_ Almighty and immortal God.

_Then shall the people stand up, and the Priest shall say_,

Hear the words of the Gospel, written by Saint John in the third
chapter, beginning at the first verse.

There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,
we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do
these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus
answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus
saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter
the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which
is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit
is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof; but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth:
so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

_After which he shall say this exhortation following_.

Beloved, ye hear in this Gospel the express words of our Saviour
Christ, that except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Whereby ye may perceive the
great necessity of this Sacrament, where it may be had. Likewise,
immediately before his ascension into heaven, (as we read in the
last chapter of Saint Mark's Gospel,) he gave command to his
disciples, saying, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel
to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Which also
sheweth unto us the great benefit we reap thereby. For which cause
Saint Peter the Apostle, when upon his first preaching of the
Gospel many were pricked at the heart, and said to him and the
rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? replied
and said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you for
the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost. For the promise is to you and your children, and to all
that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
And with many other words exhorted he them, saying, Save yourselves
from this untoward generation. For (as the same Apostle testifieth
in another place) even Baptism doth also now save us, (not the
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience towards God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly believe, that he will
favourably receive _these_ present _persons_, truly repenting,
and coming unto him by faith; that he will grant _them_ remission
of _their_ sins, and bestow upon _them_ the Holy Ghost; that he
will give _them_ the blessing of eternal life, and make _them
partakers_ of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore we being thus
persuaded of the good will of our heavenly Father towards _these
persons_, declared by his Son Jesus Christ; let us faithfully and
devoutly give thanks to him, and say,

Almighty and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble
thanks, for that thou hast vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge
of thy grace and faith in thee: Increase this knowledge, and
confirm this faith in us evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to these
persons, that they may be born again, and be made heirs of
everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth
and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever.
_Amen_.

_Then the Priest shall speak to the persons to be baptized on this
wise_.

Well-beloved, who are come hither desiring to receive holy Baptism,
_ye_ have heard how the Congregation hath prayed that our Lord
Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to receive you and bless you, to
release you of your sins, to give you the kingdom of heaven and
everlasting life. _Ye_ have heard also that our Lord Jesus Christ
hath promised in his holy Word, to grant all those things that we
have prayed for; which promise he, for his part, will most surely
keep and perform. Wherefore, after this promise made by Christ,
_ye_ must also faithfully, for your part, promise in the presence
of these your witnesses, and this whole Congregation, that _ye_
will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly believe
God's holy Word, and obediently keep his commandments.

_Then shall the Priest demand of each of the persons to be baptized,
severally, these Questions following_.

_Question_.

Dost thou renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and
glory of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the
carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow nor be
led by them?

_Answer_. I renounce them all.

_Question_.

Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth?

And in Jesus Christ his only-begotten Son our Lord? And that he was
conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; that he
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried;
that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third day;
that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God
the Father Almighty; and from thence shall come again at the end of
the world, to judge the quick and the dead?

And dost thou believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Catholic Church;
the Communion of Saints; the Remission of sins; the Resurrection of
the flesh; and everlasting life after death?

_Answer_. All this I stedfastly believe.

_Question_.

Wilt thou be baptized in this faith?

_Answer_. That is my desire.

_Question_.

Wilt thou then obediently keep God's holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same all the days of thy life?

_Answer_. I will endeavour so to do, God being my helper.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

O merciful God, grant that the old Adam in _these persons_ may be
so buried, that the new man may be raised up in _them_. _Amen_.

Grant that all carnal affections may die in _them_, and that all
things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow in _them_. _Amen_.

Grant that _they_ may have power and strength, to have victory, and
to triumph against the devil, the world, and the flesh. _Amen_.

Grant that _they_, being here dedicated to thee by our office
and ministry, may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and
everlastingly rewarded, through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God,
who dost live, and govern all things, world without end. _Amen_.

Almighty everliving God, whose most dearly beloved Son Jesus
Christ, for the forgiveness of our sins, did shed out of his
most precious side both water and blood; and gave commandment
to his disciples, that they should go teach all nations, and
baptize them in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost:
Regard, we beseech thee, the supplications of this Congregation;
sanctify this Water to the mystical washing away of sin; and grant
that the persons now to be baptized therein may receive the fulness
of thy grace, and ever remain in the number of thy faithful and
elect children; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Priest take each person to be baptized by the
right hand, and placing him conveniently by the Font, according
to his discretion, shall ask the Godfathers and Godmothers the
Name; and then shall dip him in the water, or pour water upon him,
saying_,

_N_. I baptize thee, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

We receive this person into the Congregation of Christ's flock;
and * do sign _him_ with the sign of the Cross, in token that
hereafter _he_ shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ
crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner against sin, the
world, and the devil, and to continue Christ's faithful soldier
and servant unto _his_ life's end. Amen.

* _Here the Priest shall make a Cross upon the person's forehead_.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that _these persons_ are
regenerate and grafted into the body of Christ's Church, let us
give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one
accord make our prayers unto him, that _they_ may lead the rest
of _their_ life according to this beginning.

_Then shall be said the Lord's Prayer, all kneeling_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

We yield thee humble thanks, O heavenly Father, that thou hast
vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in
thee; Increase this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us
evermore. Give thy Holy Spirit to _these persons_, that, being now
born again, and made heirs of everlasting salvation, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, _they_ may continue thy servants, and attain thy
promises; through the same Lord Jesus Christ thy Son, who liveth
and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the same Holy Spirit,
everlastingly. _Amen_.

_Then, all standing up, the Priest shall use this exhortation
following; speaking to the Godfathers and Godmothers first_.

Forasmuch as _these persons_ have promised in your presence to
renounce the devil and all his works, to believe in God, and to
serve him: Ye must remember that it is your part and duty to put
_them_ in mind, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession _they_
have now made before this Congregation, and especially before you
their chosen witnesses. And ye are also to call upon _them_ to use
all diligence to be rightly instructed in God's holy Word; that so
_they_ may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and live godly, righteously, and soberly in this present
world.

(_And then, speaking to the new baptized persons, he shall proceed,
and say_,)

And as for you, who have now by Baptism put on Christ, it is your
part and duty also, being made the _children_ of God and of the
light by faith in Jesus Christ, to walk answerably to your Christian
calling, and as becometh the children of light; remembering always,
that Baptism representeth unto us our profession; which is, to
follow the example of our Saviour Christ, and to be made like unto
him; that as he died and rose again for us, so should we, who are
baptized, die from sin and rise again unto righteousness, continually
mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding
in all virtue and godliness of living.

_It is expedient that every person, thus baptized, should be
confirmed by the Bishop so soon after his Baptism as conveniently
may be; that so he may be admitted to the holy Communion_.

_If any persons not baptized in their infancy shall be brought to
be baptized before they come to years of discretion to answer for
themselves; it may suffice to use the Office for Public Baptism of
Infants, or_ (_in case of extreme danger_) _the Office for Private
Baptism; only changing the word_ [Infant] _for_ [Child _or_ Person]
_as occasion requireth_.




A CATECHISM,

THAT IS TO SAY,

AN INSTRUCTION TO BE LEARNED OF EVERY PERSON BEFORE

HE BE BROUGHT TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE BISHOP


_Question_.

What is your Name?

_Answer_. _N_. or _NN_.

_Question_. Who gave you this Name?

_Answer_. My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism; wherein I
was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of
the kingdom of heaven.

_Question_. What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you?

_Answer_. They did promise and vow three things in my name. First,
that I should renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and
vanity of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh.
Secondly, that I should believe all the articles of the Christian
faith. And thirdly, that I should keep God's holy will and
commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.

_Question_. Dost thou not think that thou art bound to believe, and
to do, as they have promised for thee?

_Answer_. Yes verily: and by God's help so I will. And I heartily
thank our heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this state of
salvation, through Jesus Christ our Saviour. And I pray unto God
to give me his grace, that I may continue in the same unto my
life's end.

_Catechist_.

Rehearse the Articles of thy Belief.

_Answer_.

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was conceived by the
Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third
day he rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, And
sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; From thence
he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Catholic Church; The
Communion of Saints; The Forgiveness of sins; The Resurrection
of the body, And the life everlasting. Amen.

_Question_. What dost thou chiefly learn in these Articles of thy
Belief?

_Answer_. First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who hath
made me, and all the world.

Secondly, in God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all mankind.

Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me, and all the
elect people of God.

_Question_.

You said that your Godfathers and Godmothers did promise for you,
that you should keep God's Commandments. Tell me how many there be?

_Answer_. Ten.

_Question_. Which be they?

_Answer_.

The same which God spake in the twentieth chapter of Exodus,
saying, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

I. Thou shalt have none other gods but me.

II. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth
beneath, or in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down
to them, nor worship them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous
God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shew mercy
unto thousands in them that love me and keep my commandments.

III. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for
the Lord will not hold him guiltless, that taketh his Name in vain.

IV. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Six days shalt
thou labour, and do all that thou hast to do; but the seventh day
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt do no manner
of work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and
thy maid-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger that is within thy
gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

V. Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long in
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

VI. Thou shalt do no murder.

VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

VIII. Thou shalt not steal.

IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox,
nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.

_Question_.

What dost thou chiefly learn by these Commandments?

_Answer_. I learn two things: my duty towards God, and my duty
towards my Neighbour.

_Question_. What is thy duty towards God?

_Answer_. My duty towards God is to believe in him, to fear him,
and to love him, with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my
soul, and with all my strength; to worship him, to give him thanks,
to put my whole trust in him, to call upon him, to honour his holy
Name and his Word, and to serve him truly all the days of my life.

_Question_. What is thy duty towards thy Neighbour?

_Answer_. My duty towards my Neighbour is to love him as myself,
and to do to all men as I would they should do unto me: To love,
honour, and succour my father and mother: To honour and obey the
King, and all that are put in authority under him: To submit myself
to all my governors, teachers, spiritual pastors and masters: To
order myself lowly and reverently to all my betters: To hurt nobody
by word nor deed: To be true and just in all my dealing: To bear
no malice nor hatred in my heart: To keep my hands from picking and
stealing, and my tongue from evil-speaking, lying, and slandering:
To keep my body in temperance, soberness, and chastity: Not to
covet nor desire other men's goods; but to learn and labour truly
to get mine own living, and to do my duty in that state of life,
unto which it shall please God to call me.

_Catechist_.

My good child, know this, that thou art not able to do these
things of thyself, nor to walk in the commandments of God, and
to serve him, without his special grace; which thou must learn at
all times to call for by diligent prayer. Let me hear therefore if
thou canst say the Lord's Prayer.

_Answer_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Question_. What desirest thou of God in this Prayer?

_Answer_. I desire my Lord God our heavenly Father, who is the
giver of all goodness, to send his grace unto me, and to all
people, that we may worship him, serve him, and obey him, as we
ought to do. And I pray unto God, that he will send us all things
that be needful both for our souls and bodies; and that he will be
merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins; and that it will please
him to save and defend us in all dangers ghostly and bodily; and
that he will keep us from all sin and wickedness, and from our
ghostly enemy, and from everlasting death. And this I trust he will
do of his mercy and goodness, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And
therefore I say, Amen, So be it.

_Question_.

How many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in his Church?

_Answer_. Two only, as generally necessary to salvation; that is
to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.

_Question_. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?

_Answer_. I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and
spiritual grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a
means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us
thereof.

_Question_. How many parts are there in a Sacrament?

_Answer_. Two: the outward visible sign, and the inward spiritual
grace.

_Question_. What is the outward visible sign or form in Baptism?

_Answer_. Water: wherein the person is baptized, In the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

_Question_. What is the inward and spiritual grace?

_Answer_. A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness: for
being by nature born in sin, and the children of wrath, we are
hereby made the children of grace.

_Question_. What is required of persons to be baptized?

_Answer_. Repentance, whereby they forsake sin: and faith, whereby
they stedfastly believe the promises of God, made to them in that
Sacrament.

_Question_. Why then are infants baptized, when by reason of their
tender age they cannot perform them?

_Answer_. Because they promise them both by their sureties: which
promise, when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform.

_Question_. Why was the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper ordained?

_Answer_. For the continual remembrance of the sacrifice of the
death of Christ, and of the benefits which we receive thereby.

_Question_. What is the outward part or sign of the Lord's Supper?

_Answer_. Bread and Wine, which the Lord hath commanded to be
received.

_Question_. What is the inward part, or thing signified?

_Answer_. The Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily and
indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper.

_Question_. What are the benefits whereof we are partakers thereby?

_Answer_. The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the Body
and Blood of Christ, as our bodies are by the Bread and Wine.

_Question_. What is required of them who come to the Lord's Supper?

_Answer_. To examine themselves, whether they repent them truly of
their former sins, stedfastly purposing to lead a new life; have a
lively faith in God's mercy through Christ, with a thankful
remembrance of his death; and be in charity with all men.

_The Curate of every Parish shall diligently upon Sundays and
Holy-days, after the second Lesson at Evening Prayer, openly in
the Church instruct and examine so many Children of his Parish sent
unto him, as he shall think convenient, in some part of this
Catechism_.

_And all Fathers, Mothers, Masters, and Dames, shall cause their
Children, Servants, and Prentices,_ (_which have not learned their
Catechism,_) _to come to the Church at the time appointed, and
obediently to hear and be ordered by the Curate, until such time
as they have learned all that is here appointed for them to learn_.

_So soon as Children are come to a competent age, and can say, in
their mother tongue, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten
Commandments; and also can answer to the other questions of this
short Catechism; they shall be brought to the Bishop: And every one
shall have a Godfather, or a Godmother, as a witness of their
Confirmation_.

_And whensoever the Bishop shall give knowledge for Children to be
brought unto him for their Confirmation, the Curate of every Parish
shall either bring or send in writing, with his hand subscribed
thereunto, the names of all such persons within his Parish, as he
shall think fit to be presented to the Bishop to be confirmed. And,
if the Bishop approve of them, he shall confirm, them in manner
following_.




THE ORDER OF CONFIRMATION,

OR LAYING ON OF HANDS UPON THOSE THAT ARE BAPTIZED

AND COME TO YEARS OF DISCRETION


_Upon the day appointed, all that are to be then confirmed, being
placed, and standing in order before the Bishop; he_ (_or some
other Minister appointed by him_) _shall read this Preface
following_.

To the end that Confirmation maybe ministered to the more edifying
of such as shall receive it, the Church hath thought good to order,
That none hereafter shall be confirmed, but such as can say the
Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments; and can also
answer to such other questions, as in the short Catechism are
contained: which order is very convenient to be observed; to the
end that children being now come to the years of discretion, and
having learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promised for
them in Baptism, they may themselves, with their own mouth and
consent, openly before the Church, ratify and confirm the same;
and also promise, that by the grace of God they will evermore
endeavour themselves faithfully to observe such things, as they
by their own confession have assented unto.

_Then shall the Bishop say_,

Do ye here, in the presence of God, and of this Congregation, renew
the solemn promise and vow that was made in your name at your
Baptism; ratifying and confirming the same in your own persons,
and acknowledging yourselves bound to believe and to do all those
things, which your Godfathers and Godmothers then undertook for you?

_And every one shall audibly answer_,

I do.

_The Bishop_.

Our help is in the Name of the Lord;

_Answer_. Who hath made heaven and earth.

_Bishop_. Blessed be the Name of the Lord;

_Answer_. Henceforth world without end.

_Bishop_. Lord, hear our prayers.

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

_Bishop_.

Let us pray.

Almighty and ever-living God, who hast vouchsafed to regenerate
these thy servants by Water and the Holy Ghost, and hast given
unto them forgiveness of all their sins: Strengthen them, we
beseech thee, O Lord, with the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and daily
increase in them thy manifold gifts of grace; the spirit of wisdom
and understanding; the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength; the
spirit of knowledge and true godliness; and fill them, O Lord, with
the spirit of thy holy fear, now and for ever. _Amen_.

_Then all of them in order kneeling before the Bishop, he shall
lay his hand upon the head of every one severally, saying_,

Defend, O Lord, this thy Child [or _this thy Servant_] with thy
heavenly grace, that _he_ may continue thine for ever; and daily
increase in thy Holy Spirit, more and more, until _he_ come unto
thy everlasting kingdom. Amen.

_Then shall the Bishop say_,

The Lord be with you.

_Answer_. And with thy spirit.

_And_ (_all kneeling down_) _the Bishop shall add_,

Let us pray.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, But
deliver us from evil. Amen.

_And this Collect_.

Almighty and everliving God, who makest us both to will and to
do those things that be good and acceptable unto thy divine
Majesty; We make our humble supplications unto thee for these thy
servants, upon whom (after the example of thy holy Apostles) we have
now laid our hands, to certify them (by this sign) of thy favour and
gracious goodness towards them. Let thy fatherly hand, we beseech
thee, ever be over them; let thy Holy Spirit ever be with them; and
so lead them in the knowledge and obedience of thy Word, that in
the end they may obtain everlasting life; through our Lord Jesus
Christ, who with thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth, ever
one God, world without end. _Amen._

O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee,
to direct, sanctify and govern both our hearts and bodies, in the
ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through
thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be preserved
in body and soul; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

_Then the Bishop shall bless them, saying thus_,

The Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, be upon you, and remain with you, for ever. _Amen_.

_And there shall none be admitted to the holy Communion, until such
time as he be confirmed, or be ready and desirous to be confirmed_.




| AN ALTERNATIVE ORDER FOR THE
|
|MINISTRATION OF CONFIRMATION
|
|AS CANONICALLY SANCTIONED IN THE SCOTTISH CHURCH
|
|
| _The circumstances of this Church requiring on many occasions
| such modifications of the Order of Confirmation as may render
| it appropriate to candidates who had not godfathers and
| godmothers at their baptism, the Bishop may substitute for the
| Preface in the Order of Confirmation in the Book of Common
| Prayer a suitable address, and may substitute for the question
| Do ye here, etc., the three following questions_:
|
| Dost thou renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp

| and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow
| nor be led by them?
|
| _Answer_. I do.
|
| Dost thou believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven

|
| _The Bishop, when administering Confirmation, may at his

| of Common Prayer_:
|
| _N_. I sign thee with the sign of the cross [_here the Bishop
| shall sign the person with the sign of the cross on the
| forehead_] and I lay my hands [_or_ hand] upon thee, in the
| Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
|
| Defend, O Lord, this thy Child [_or_ this thy Servant] with thy

| unto thy everlasting kingdom. Amen.
|
| _Then shall the Bishop say_,

| The Lord be with you.
|
| _Answer_. And with thy spirit.
|
| _And_ (_all kneeling down_) _the Bishop shall add_,
|
| Let us pray.

| O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech
| thee, to direct, sanctify and govern both our hearts and
| bodies, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy
| commandments; that through thy most mighty protection, both
| here and ever, we may be preserved in body and soul; through
| our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. _Amen_.
|
| _Then the Bishop shall bless them, saying thus_,
|
| The Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
| Ghost, be upon you, and remain with you, for ever. _Amen_.




THE FORM OF SOLEMNIZATION OF MATRIMONY


_First, the Banns of all that are to be married together must be
published in the Church three several Sundays, during the time of
Morning Service, or of Evening Service_, (_if there be no Morning
Service,_) _immediately after the second Lesson; the Curate saying
after the accustomed manner_, I publish the Banns of Marriage
between _N_. of and _N_. of------. If any of you know cause, or
just impediment, why these two persons should not be joined together
in holy Matrimony, ye are to declare it. This is the first [second,
_or_ third] time of asking.

_And if the persons that are to be married dwell in divers
Parishes, the Banns must be asked in both Parishes; and the
Curate of the one Parish shall not solemnize Matrimony betwixt
them, without a Certificate of the Banns being thrice asked, from
the Curate of the other Parish_.

_At the day and time appointed for solemnization of Matrimony, the
persons to be married shall come into the body of the Church with
their friends and neighbours: and there standing together, the man
on the right hand, and the woman on the left, the Priest shall say_,

Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God,
and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and
this woman in holy Matrimony; which is an honourable estate,
instituted of God in the time of man's innocency, signifying unto
us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church; which
holy estate Christ adorned and beautified with his presence, and
first miracle that he wrought, in Cana of Galilee; and is commended
of Saint Paul to be honourable among all men: and therefore is not
by any to be enterprized, nor taken in hand, unadvisedly, lightly,
or wantonly, to satisfy men's carnal lusts and appetites, like
brute beasts that have no understanding; but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God; duly considering the
causes for which Matrimony was ordained.

First, It was ordained for the procreation of children, to be
brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise
of his holy Name.

Secondly, It was ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid
fornication; that such persons as have not the gift of continency
might marry, and keep themselves undefiled members of Christ's body.

Thirdly, It was ordained for the mutual society, help, and comfort,
that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and
adversity. Into which holy estate these two persons present come
now to be joined. Therefore if any man can shew any just cause,
why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak,
or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.

| _The Clergyman may at his discretion shorten the prefatory_
| _address by reading it thus_:
|
| Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of
| God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this
| man and this woman in holy Matrimony: which is an honourable
| estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency,
| signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt Christ
| and his Church; which holy estate Christ adorned and beautified
| with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of
| Galilee; and is commended in Holy Writ to be honourable among all
| men; and therefore is not by any to be taken in hand, unadvisedly,
| lightly or wantonly; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
| soberly, and in the fear of God; duly considering the chief causes
| for which Matrimony was ordained.
|
| It was ordained for the increase of mankind according to the will
| of God, and that children might be brought up in the fear and
| nurture of the Lord and to the praise of his holy Name.
|
| It was also ordained for the mutual society, help, and comfort
| that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and
| adversity.
|
| Into which holy estate these two persons present come now to be
| joined. Therefore if any man can shew any just cause why they
| may not lawfully be joined together, let him now declare it.

_And also, speaking unto the persons that shall be married, he
shall say_,

I require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day
of judgement, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed,
that if either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be
lawfully joined together in Matrimony, ye do now confess it. For
be ye well assured, that so many as are coupled together otherwise
than God's Word doth allow are not joined together by God; neither
is their Matrimony lawful.

_At which day of Marriage, if any man do allege and declare any
impediment, why they may not be coupled together in Matrimony, by
God's law, or the laws of this Realm; and will be bound, and
sufficient sureties with him, to the parties; or else put in a
caution_ (_to the full value of such charges as the persons to be
married do thereby sustain_) _to prove his allegation: then the
solemnization must be deferred, until such time as the truth be
tried_.

_If no impediment be alleged, then shall the Curate say unto the
man_,

_N_. Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long
as ye both shall live?

_The man shall answer_,

I will.

_Then shall the Priest say unto the woman_,

_N_. Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live
together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony?
Wilt thou obey him, and serve him, love, honour, and keep him,
in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee
only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?

_The woman shall answer_,

I will.

_Then shall the Minister say_,

Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?

_Then shall they give their troth to each other in this manner_.

_The Minister, receiving the woman at her father's or friend's
hands, shall cause the man with his right hand to take the woman
by her right hand, and to say after him as followeth_.

I _N_. take thee _N_. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold from
this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in
sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do
part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee
my troth.

_Then shall they loose their hands; and the woman, with her right
hand taking the man by his right hand, shall likewise say after
the Minister_,

I _N_. take thee _N_. to my wedded husband, to have and to hold
from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till
death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto
I give thee my troth.

_Then shall they again loose their hands; and the man shall give
unto the woman a ring, laying the same upon the book with the
accustomed duty to the Priest and Clerk. And the Priest, taking
the ring, shall deliver it unto the man, to put it upon the fourth
finger of the woman's left hand. And the man holding the ring
there, and taught by the Priest, shall say_,

With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with
all my worldly goods I thee endow: In the Name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_Then the man leaving the ring upon the fourth finger of the
woman's left hand, they shall both kneel down, and the Minister
shall say_,

Let us pray.

O eternal God, Creator and Preserver of all mankind, Giver of all
spiritual grace, the Author of everlasting life: Send thy blessing
upon these thy servants, this man and this woman, whom we bless in
thy Name; that, as Isaac and Rebecca lived faithfully together, so
these persons may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant
betwixt them made, (whereof this ring given and received is a token
and pledge,) and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together,
and live according to thy laws; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

_Then shall the Priest join their right hands together, and say_,

Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.

_Then shall the Minister speak unto the people_.

Foreasmuch as _N_. and _N_. have consented together in holy
wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company,
and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to other,
and have declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring, and
by joining of hands; I pronounce that they be man and wife
together, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost. _Amen_.

_And the Minister shall add this Blessing_.

God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve,
and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favour look upon you,
and so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye
may so live together in this life, that in the world to come ye may
have life everlasting. Amen.

_Then the Minister or Clerks, going to the Lord's Table, shall say
or sing this Psalm following_.

_Beati omnes_. Psalm cxxviii.

Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.

For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: O well is thee, and
happy shalt thou be.

Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thy house;

Thy children like the olive branches: round about thy table.

Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.

The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see
Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;

Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon
Israel.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Or this Psalm_.

_Deus miser eatur_. Psalm lxvii.

God be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto us:

That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all
nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise
thee.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the
folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.

Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise
thee.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our
own God, shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_The Psalm ended, and the man and the woman kneeling before the
Lord's Table, the Priest standing at the Table, and turning his
face towards them, shall say_,

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Answer_. Christ, have mercy upon us.

_Minister_. Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Minister_. O Lord, save thy servant, and thy handmaid;

_Answer_. Who put their trust in thee.

_Minister_. O Lord, send them help from thy holy place;

_Answer_. And evermore defend them.

_Minister_. Be unto them a tower of strength;

_Answer_. From the face of their enemy.

_Minister_. O Lord, hear our prayer;

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

_Minister_.

O God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, bless these thy
servants, and sow the seed of eternal life in their hearts; that
whatsoever in thy holy Word they shall profitably learn, they may
in deed fulfil the same. Look, O Lord, mercifully upon them from
heaven, and bless them. And as thou didst send thy blessing upon
Abraham and Sarah, to their great comfort, so vouchsafe to send
thy blessing upon these thy servants; that they obeying thy will,
and alway being in safety under thy protection, may abide in thy
love unto their lives end; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_This Prayer next following shall be omitted, where the woman is
past child-bearing_.

O merciful Lord, and heavenly Father, by whose gracious gift
mankind is increased: We beseech thee, assist with thy blessing
these two persons, that they may both be fruitful in procreation
of children, and also live together so long in godly love and
honesty, that they may see their children christianly and virtuously
brought up, to thy praise and honour; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

| _Or this prayer following may be used_.
|
| O almighty God, Creator of mankind, who only art the well-spring
| of life: Bestow upon these thy servants, if it be thy will, the
| gift and heritage of children; and grant that they may see their
| children brought up in thy faith and fear to the honour and glory
| of thy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

O God, who by thy mighty power hast made all things of nothing; who
also (after other things set in order) didst appoint, that out of man
(created after thine own image and similitude) woman should take her
beginning; and, knitting them together, didst teach that it should
never be lawful to put asunder those whom thou by Matrimony hadst
made one: O God, who hast consecrated the state of Matrimony to such
an excellent mystery, that in it is signified and represented the
spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and his Church: Look
mercifully upon these thy servants, that both this man may love his
wife, according to thy Word, (as Christ did love his spouse the
Church, who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it even as
his own flesh,) and also that this woman may be loving and amiable,
faithful and obedient to her husband; and in all quietness, sobriety,
and peace, be a follower of holy and godly matrons. O Lord, bless
them both, and grant them to inherit thy everlasting kingdom;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Priest say_,

Almighty God, who at the beginning did create our first parents,
Adam and Eve, and did sanctify and join them together in marriage;
Pour upon you the riches of his grace, sanctify and bless you, that
ye may please him both in body and soul, and live together in holy
love unto your lives end. _Amen_.

_After which, if there be no Sermon declaring the duties of man and
wife, the Minister shall read as followeth_.

All ye that are married, or that intend to take the holy estate
of Matrimony upon you, hear what the holy Scripture doth say as
touching the duty of husbands towards their wives, and wives
towards their husbands.

Saint Paul, in his Epistle to the Ephesians, the fifth Chapter,
doth give this commandment to all married men; Husbands, love your
wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for
it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water,
by the word; that he might present it to himself a glorious Church,
not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
be holy, and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as
their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself: for no
man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
even as the Lord the Church: for we are members of his body, of his
flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father
and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife; and they two shall be
one flesh. This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ
and the Church. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so
love his wife, even as himself.

Likewise the same Saint Paul, writing to the Colossians, speaketh
thus to all men that are married; Husbands, love your wives, and be
not bitter against them.

Hear also what Saint Peter, the Apostle of Christ, who was himself
a married man, saith unto them that are married; Ye husbands, dwell
with your wives according to knowledge; giving honour unto the
wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the
grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.

Hitherto ye have heard the duty of the husband toward the wife.
Now likewise, ye wives, hear and learn your duties toward your
husbands, even as it is plainly set forth in holy Scripture.

Saint Paul, in the aforenamed Epistle to the Ephesians, teacheth
you thus; Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto
the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ
is the head of the Church: and he is the Saviour of the body.
Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be
to their own husbands in every thing. And again he saith, Let the
wife see that she reverence her husband.

And in his Epistle to the Colossians, Saint Paul giveth you this
short lesson; Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as
it is fit in the Lord.

Saint Peter also doth instruct you very well, thus saying; Ye wives,
be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the
word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of
the wives; while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with
fear. Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of
plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of
apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which
is not corruptible; even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner
in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned
themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands; even as
Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye are as
long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

| _The concluding address may be omitted, and unless the holy
Communion_ _immediately follow, the congregation may be dismissed
with_ _a Benediction_.

_It is convenient that the new-married persons should receive the
holy Communion at the time of their Marriage, or at the first
opportunity after their Marriage_.




THE ORDER FOR

THE VISITATION OF THE SICK


_When any person is sick, notice shall be given thereof to the
Minister of the Parish; who, coming into the sick person's house,
shall say_,

Peace be to this house, and to all that dwell in it.

_When he cometh into the sick man's presence he shall say, kneeling
down_,

Remember not, Lord, our iniquities, nor the iniquities of our
forefathers: Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast
redeemed with thy most precious blood, and be not angry with us
for ever.

_Answer_. Spare us, good Lord.

_Then the Minister shall say_,

Let us pray.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Minister_. O Lord, save thy servant;

_Answer_. Which putteth _his_ trust in thee.

_Minister_. Send _him_ help from thy holy place;

_Answer_. And evermore mightily defend _him_.

_Minister_. Let the enemy have no advantage of _him_;

_Answer_. Nor the wicked approach to hurt _him_.

_Minister_. Be unto _him_, O Lord, a strong tower;

_Answer_. From the face of _his_ enemy.

_Minister_. O Lord, hear our prayers.

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

_Minister_.

O Lord, look down from heaven, behold, visit, and relieve this thy
servant. Look upon _him_ with the eyes of thy mercy, give _him_
comfort and sure confidence in thee, defend _him_ from the danger
of the enemy, and keep _him_ in perpetual peace and safety; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Hear us, Almighty and most merciful God and Saviour; extend thy
accustomed goodness to this thy servant who is grieved with
sickness. Sanctify, we beseech thee, this thy fatherly correction
to _him_; that the sense of _his_ weakness may add strength to
_his_ faith, and seriousness to _his_ repentance: that, if it shall
be thy good pleasure to restore _him_ to _his_ former health, _he_
may lead the residue of _his_ life in thy fear, and to thy glory:
or else give _him_ grace so to take thy visitation, that, after this
painful life ended, _he_ may dwell with thee in life everlasting;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Minister exhort the sick person after this form,
or other like_.

Dearly beloved, know this, that Almighty God is the Lord of life
and death, and of all things to them pertaining, as youth, strength,
health, age, weakness, and sickness. Wherefore, whatsoever your
sickness is, know you certainly, that it is God's visitation. And
for what cause soever this sickness is sent unto you; whether it be
to try your patience, for the example of others, and that your
faith may be found in the day of the Lord laudable, glorious, and
honourable, to the increase of glory and endless felicity; or else
it be sent unto you to correct and amend in you whatsoever doth
offend the eyes of your heavenly Father; know you certainly, that
if you truly repent you of your sins, and bear your sickness
patiently, trusting in God's mercy for his dear Son Jesus Christ's
sake, and render unto him humble thanks for his fatherly visitation,
submitting yourself wholly unto his will, it shall turn to your
profit, and help you forward in the right way that leadeth unto
everlasting life.

_If the person visited be very sick, then the Curate may end his
exhortation in this place, or else proceed_.

Take therefore in good part the chastisement of the Lord: For
(as Saint Paul saith in the twelfth chapter to the Hebrews) whom
the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he
receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with
sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if
ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are
ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
flesh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we
not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and
live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
holiness. These words, good _brother_, are written in holy Scripture
for our comfort and instruction; that we should patiently, and with
thanksgiving, bear our heavenly Father's correction, whensoever by
any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to
visit us. And there should be no greater comfort to Christian
persons, than to be made like unto Christ, by suffering patiently
adversities, troubles, and sicknesses. For he himself went not up
to joy, but first he suffered pain; he entered not into his glory
before he was crucified. So truly our way to eternal joy is to
suffer here with Christ; and our door to enter into eternal life
is gladly to die with Christ; that we may rise again from death,
and dwell with him in everlasting life. Now therefore, taking your
sickness, which is thus profitable for you, patiently, I exhort
you, in the name of God, to remember the profession which you made
unto God in your Baptism. And forasmuch as after this life there
is an account to be given unto the righteous Judge, by whom all
must be judged without respect of persons, I require you to examine
yourself and your estate, both toward God and man; so that, accusing
and condemning yourself for your own faults, you may find mercy at
our heavenly Father's hand for Christ's sake, and not be accused
and condemned in that fearful judgement. Therefore I shall rehearse
to you the Articles of our Faith, that you may know whether you do
believe as a Christian man should, or no.

_Here the Minister shall rehearse the Articles of the Faith, saying
thus_,

Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth?

And in Jesus Christ his only-begotten Son our Lord? And that he was
conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; that he
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried;
that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third day;
that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God
the Father Almighty; and from thence shall come again at the end of
the world, to judge the quick and the dead?

And dost thou believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Catholic Church;
the Communion of Saints; the Remission of sins; the Resurrection of
the flesh; and everlasting life after death?

_The sick person shall answer_,

All this I stedfastly believe.

_Then shall the Minister examine whether he repent him truly of
his sins, and be in charity with all the world; exhorting him to
forgive, from the bottom of his heart, all persons that have
offended him; and if he have offended any other, to ask them
forgiveness; and where he hath done injury or wrong to any man,
that he make amends to the uttermost of his power. And if he have
not before disposed of his goods, let him then be admonished to
make his Will, and to declare his debts, what he oweth, and what
is owing unto him; for the better discharging of his conscience,
and the quietness of his Executors. But men should often be put in
remembrance to take order for the settling of their temporal
estates whilst they are in health_.

_These words before rehearsed may be said before the Minister
begin his Prayer, as he shall see cause_.

_The Minister should not omit earnestly to move such sick persons
as are of ability to be liberal to the poor_.

_Here shall the sick person be moved to make a special confession
of his sins, if he feel his conscience troubled with any weighty
matter. After which confession, the Priest shall absolve him_ (_if
he humbly and heartily desire it_) _after this sort_.

Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church to
absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of his
great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority
committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, In the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_And then the Priest shall say the Collect following_.

Let us pray.

O most merciful God, who, according to the multitude of thy
mercies, dost so put away the sins of those who truly repent, that
thou rememberest them no more: Open thine eye of mercy upon this
thy servant, who most earnestly desireth pardon and forgiveness.
Renew in _him_ (most loving Father) whatsoever hath been decayed by
the fraud and malice of the devil, or by _his_ own carnal will and
frailness; preserve and continue this sick member in the unity of
the Church; consider _his_ contrition, accept _his_ tears, assuage
_his_ pain, as shall seem to thee most expedient for _him_. And
forasmuch as _he_ putteth _his_ full trust only in thy mercy,
impute not unto _him his_ former sins, but strengthen _him_ with
thy blessed Spirit; and, when thou art pleased to take _him_ hence,
take _him_ unto thy favour, through the merits of thy most dearly
beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Minister say this Psalm_.

_In te, Domine, speravi_. Psalm lxxi.

In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust; let me never be put to
confusion: but rid me, and deliver me in thy righteousness;
incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast
promised to help me; for thou art my house of defence, and my
castle.

Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my
hope, even from my youth.

Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art
he that took me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall alway be
of thee.

I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is
in thee.

O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy
glory and honour all the day long.

Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my
strength faileth me.

For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my
soul take their counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him,
persecute him, and take him; for there is none to deliver him.

Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.

Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let
them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.

As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more
and more.

My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation:
for I know no end thereof.

I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make
mention of thy righteousness only.

Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore
will I tell of thy wondrous works.

Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed:
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
power to all them that are yet for to come.

Thy righteousness, O God, is very high, and great things are they
that thou hast done: O God, who is like unto thee?

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Adding this_.

O Saviour of the world, who by thy Cross and precious Blood hast
redeemed us: Save us, and help us, we humbly beseech thee, O Lord.

_Then shall the Minister say_,

The Almighty Lord, who is a most strong tower to all them that put
their trust in him, to whom all things in heaven, in earth, and
under the earth, do bow and obey, be now and evermore thy defence;
and make thee know and feel, that there is none other Name under
heaven given to man, in whom, and through whom, thou mayest receive
health and salvation, but only the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.

_And after that shall say_,

Unto God's gracious mercy and protection we commit thee. The Lord
bless thee, and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon
thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance
upon thee, and give thee peace, both now and evermore. _Amen_.

_A Prayer for a sick Child_.

O almighty God, and merciful Father, to whom alone belong the
issues of life and death: Look down from heaven, we humbly beseech
thee, with the eyes of mercy upon this child now lying upon the
bed of sickness. Visit _him_, O Lord, with thy salvation; deliver
_him_ in thy good appointed time from _his_ bodily pain, and save
_his_ soul for thy mercies sake: that, if it shall be thy pleasure
to prolong _his_ days here on earth, _he_ may live to thee, and be
an instrument of thy glory, by serving thee faithfully, and doing
good in _his_ generation; or else receive _him_ into those heavenly
habitations, where the souls of them that sleep in the Lord Jesus
enjoy perpetual rest and felicity. Grant this, O Lord, for thy
mercies' sake, in the same thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who
liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God,
world without end. _Amen_.

_A Prayer for a sick person, when there appeareth small hope of
recovery_.

O Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, our only help in time
of need: We fly unto thee for succour in behalf of this thy
servant, here lying under thy hand in great weakness of body. Look
graciously upon _him_, O Lord; and the more the outward man
decayeth, strengthen _him_, we beseech thee, so much the more
continually with thy grace and Holy Spirit in the inner man. Give
_him_ unfeigned repentance for all the errors of _his_ life past,
and stedfast faith in thy Son Jesus; that _his_ sins may be done
away by thy mercy, and _his_ pardon sealed in heaven, before  _he_
go hence, and be no more seen. We know, O Lord, that there is no
word impossible with thee; and that, if thou wilt, thou canst even
yet raise _him_ up, and grant _him_ a longer continuance amongst us:
Yet, forasmuch as in all appearance the time of _his_ dissolution
draweth near, so fit and prepare _him_, we beseech thee, against
the hour of death, that after _his_ departure hence in peace, and
in thy favour, _his_ soul may be received into thine everlasting
kingdom, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, thine
only Son, our Lord and Saviour. _Amen_.

_A commendatory Prayer for a sick person at the point of departure_.

O almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of just men made
perfect, after they are delivered from their earthly prisons: We
humbly commend the soul of this thy servant, our dear _brother_,
into thy hands, as into the hands of a faithful Creator, and most
merciful Saviour; most humbly beseeching thee that it may be
precious in thy sight. Wash it, we pray thee, in the blood of that
immaculate Lamb, that was slain to take away the sins of the world;
that whatsoever defilements it may have contracted in the midst
of this miserable and naughty world, through the lusts of the flesh
or the wiles of Satan, being purged and done away, it may be
presented pure and without spot before thee. And teach us who
survive, in this and other like daily spectacles of mortality, to
see how frail and uncertain our own condition is; and so to number
our days, that we may seriously apply our hearts to that holy and
heavenly wisdom, whilst we live here, which may in the end bring
us to life everlasting, through the merits of Jesus Christ, thine
only Son our Lord. _Amen_.

_A Prayer for persons troubled in mind or in conscience_.

O blessed Lord, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comforts:
We beseech thee, look down in pity and compassion upon this thy
afflicted servant. Thou writest bitter things against _him_, and
makest _him_ to possess _his_ former iniquities; thy wrath lieth
hard upon _him_, and _his_ soul is full of trouble: But, O merciful
God, who hast written thy holy Word for our learning, that we,
through patience and comfort of thy holy Scriptures, might have
hope; give _him_ a right understanding of _himself_, and of thy
threats and promises; that _he_ may neither cast away _his_
confidence in thee, nor place it any where but in thee. Give _him_
strength against all _his_ temptations, and heal all _his_
distempers. Break not the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
flax. Shut not up thy tender mercies in displeasure; but make
_him_ to hear of joy and gladness, that the bones which thou
hast broken may rejoice. Deliver _him_ from fear of the enemy,
and lift up the light of thy countenance upon _him_, and give
_him_ peace, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

| _A Prayer for the recovery of a sick person_.
|
| Almighty and immortal God, giver of life and health; We beseech
thee to hear our prayers for thy servant _N_., for whom we implore
thy mercy, that by thy blessing upon _him_ and upon those who
minister to _him_ of thy healing gifts, _he_ may be restored,
if it be thy gracious will, to health of body and mind, and give
thanks to thee in thy holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.




THE COMMUNION OF THE SICK


_Forasmuch as all mortal men be subject to many sudden perils,
diseases, and sicknesses, and ever uncertain what time they shall
depart out of this life; therefore, to the intent they may be
always in a readiness to die, whensoever it shall please Almighty
God to call them, the Curates shall diligently from time to time_
(_but especially in the time of pestilence, or other infectious
sickness_) _exhort their Parishioners to the often receiving of
the holy Communion of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ,
when it shall be publicly administered in the Church; that so
doing, they may, in case of sudden visitation, have the less cause
to be disquieted for lack of the same. But if the sick person be
not able to come to the Church, and yet is desirous to receive the
Communion in his house; then he must give timely notice to the
Curate, signifying also how many there are to communicate with
him,_ (_which shall be three, or two at the least,_) _and having a
convenient place in the sick man's house, with all things necessary
so prepared, that the Curate may reverently minister, he shall
there celebrate the holy Communion, beginning with the Collect,
Epistle and Gospel here following_.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty everliving God, Maker of mankind, who dost correct those
whom thou dost love, and chastise every one whom thou dost receive:
We beseech thee to have mercy upon this thy servant visited with
thine hand; and to grant that _he_ may take _his_ sickness patiently,
and recover _his_ bodily health, (if it be thy gracious will,) and
whensoever _his_ soul shall depart from the body, it may be without
spot presented unto thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Hebr. xii. 5.

My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

THE GOSPEL. St John v. 24.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

_After which the Priest shall proceed according to the form before
prescribed for the holy Communion, beginning at these words_ [Ye
that do truly, &c.], p. 316.

_At the time of the distribution of the holy Sacrament, the Priest
shall first receive the Communion himself, and after minister unto
them that are appointed to communicate with the sick; and last of
all to the sick person_.

_But if a man, either by reason of extremity of sickness, or for
want of warning in due time to the Curate, or for lack of company
to receive with him, or by any other just impediment, do not receive
the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood: the Curate shall instruct
him that if he do truly repent him of his sins, and stedfastly
believe that Jesus Christ hath suffered death upon the Cross for
him, and shed his Blood for his redemption, earnestly remembering
the benefits he hath thereby, and giving him hearty thanks therefor;
he doth eat and drink the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ
profitably to his soul's health, although he do not receive the
Sacrament with his mouth_.

_When the sick person is visited and receiveth the holy Communion
all at one time, then the Priest, for more expedition, shall cut
off the form of the Visitation at the Psalm_ [In thee, O Lord, have
I put my trust] _and go straight to the Communion_.

_In the time of the plague, sweat, or such other like contagious
times of sickness or diseases, when none of the Parish or neighbours
can be gotten to communicate with the sick in their houses, for
fear of the infection, upon special request of the diseased, the
Minister may only communicate with him_.




THE ORDER FOR

THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD


_Here is to be noted, that the Office ensuing is not to be used for
any that die unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have laid violent
hands upon themselves_.

_The Priest and Clerks meeting the corpse at the entrance of
the Church-yard, and going before it, either into the Church,
or towards the grave, shall say, or sing_:

I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. _St John_
xi. 25, 26.

I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for
myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. _Job_ xix.
25, 26, 27.

We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
nothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed
be the name of the Lord. 1 _Tim_. vi. 7. _Job_ i. 21.

_After they are come into the Church, shall be read one or both of
these Psalms following_.

_Dixi, Custodiam_. Psalm xxxix.

I said, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.

I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly
is in my sight.

I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even
from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.

My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire
kindled: and at the last I spake with my tongue;

Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may
be certified how long I have to live.

Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine
age is even as nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man
living is altogether vanity.

For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain:
he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.

And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.

Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto
the foolish.

I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.

Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by means of thy
heavy hand.

When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his
beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment:
every man therefore is but vanity.

Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling:
hold not thy peace at my tears.

For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers
were.

O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go
hence, and be no more seen.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Domine, refugium_. Psalm xc.

Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.

Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and
the world were made: thou art God from everlasting, and world
without end.

Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again,
ye children of men.

For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing
that is past as a watch in the night.

As soon as thou scatterest them, they are even as asleep: and
fade away suddenly like the grass.

In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening
it is cut down, dried up, and withered.

For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy
wrathful indignation.

Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in
the light of thy countenance.

For when thou art angry, all our days are gone: we bring our
years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.

The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though
men be so strong, that they come to fourscore years: yet is their
strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and
we are gone.

But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as
a man feareth, so is thy displeasure.

O teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom.

Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy
servants.

O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice
and be glad all the days of our life.

Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us:
and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.

Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.

And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper
thou the work of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handy-work.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Then shall follow the Lesson taken out of the fifteenth chapter
of the former Epistle of Saint Paul to the Corinthians_.

1 Cor. xv. 20.

Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of
them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ
the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming.
Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and
all authority, and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all
enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death. [For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he
saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is
excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things
shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be
subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be
all in all. Else what shall they do which are baptized for the
dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for
the dead? And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? I protest by
your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die. Be not deceived: evil communications
corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and sin not: for
some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest
not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of
wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body, as it
hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. All flesh is
not the same flesh; but there is one kind of flesh of men, another
flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are
also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; but the glory of
the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.]
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another
star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is
sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is
raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And
so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the
last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit, that was not first
which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that
which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the
second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are
they that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also
that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say,
brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;
neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a
mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
immortality; then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin;
and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which
giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my
beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in
the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not
in vain in the Lord.

| Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and

| not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
| Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,

| that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself; so

|
| St John vi. 37.

| All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
| cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from

| shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said
| unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth
| in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
| liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
| She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
| Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
|
| 2 Cor. iv. 16.
|
| For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
| yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction,
| which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding
| and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things
| which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the
| things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are
| not seen are eternal. For we know that if our earthly house of
| this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an
| house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this
| we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
| which is from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not
| be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
| being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed
| upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now he that
| hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath
| given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we are always
| confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we
| are absent from the Lord: (for we walk by faith, not by sight:)
| we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the
| body, and to be present with the Lord. Wherefore we labour,
| that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For
| we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ; that
| every one may receive the things done in his body, according to
| that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
|
| 1 Thess. iv. 13:
|
| I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
| which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have
| no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even
| so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For
| this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
| alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
| them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from
| heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
| the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then
| we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
| them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
| ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these
| words.

| Rev. vii. 9.
|
| After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
| could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
| tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
| with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a
| loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the
| throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about
| the throne, and about the elders, and the four beasts, and fell
| before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying,
| Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and
| honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever:
| Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are
| these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
| And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These
| are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
| their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
| Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
| and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall
| dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any
| more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For
| the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
| and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God
| shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
|
| Rev. xxi. 3.
|
| And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
| tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
| they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,
| and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their
| eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
| crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former
| things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said,
| Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for
| these words are true and faithful.

Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is
full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he
fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.

In the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for
succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly
displeased?

Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most
merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal
death.

Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy
merciful ears to our prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O
God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy
Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour for any pains of
death, to fall from thee.

_Then, while the earth shall be cast upon the body by some standing
by, the Priest shall say_,

Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to
take unto himself the soul of our dear _brother_ here departed:
we therefore commit _his_ body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the resurrection
to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change
our vile body, that it may be like unto his glorious body, according
to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to
himself.

| _An alternative form of Committal to the ground_.
|
| Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God in his wise providence
| to take unto himself the soul of our _brother_ here departed: we
| therefore commit _his_ body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes
| to ashes, dust to dust; looking for the general resurrection in
| the last day, and the life of the world to come, through our Lord
| Jesus Christ, who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation
| that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to
| the mighty working whereby he is able to subject all things to
| himself.
|
| _At the burial of the dead at sea, the words_ to the deep _shall
| be substituted for the words_ to the ground, _and the words_
| earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust _shall be omitted_.

Then shall be said or sung,

I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write: From henceforth
blessed are the dead which die in the Lord: Even so, saith the
Spirit, for they rest from their labours.

_Then the Priest shall say_,

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Priest_.

Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart
hence in the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful, after
they are delivered from the burden of the flesh, are in joy and
felicity: We give thee hearty thanks, for that it hath pleased
thee to deliver this our _brother_ out of the miseries of this
sinful world; beseeching thee that it may please thee, of thy
gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine
elect, and to hasten thy kingdom; that we, with all those that
are departed in the true faith of thy holy Name, may have our
perfect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in thy
eternal and everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

THE COLLECT.

O merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live,
though he die; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in him, shall
not die eternally; who also hath taught us (by his holy Apostle
Saint Paul) not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that
sleep in him: We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from
the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that, when we
shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this
our _brother_ doth; and that, at the general resurrection in the
last day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight, and receive
that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to
all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of
my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning
of the world: Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father,
through Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Redeemer. _Amen_.

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. _Amen_.




| AT THE BURIAL OF BAPTIZED CHILDREN

|
| _It is permitted_:
|
| _To add to the opening sentences, this_:
|
| Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and

|
| _To substitute for the appointed psalms_:

|
| The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.

|
| He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of

|

|
| _To substitute for the appointed Lesson_:
|
| St Matth. xviii. 1.
|
| At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
| the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little
| child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said,
| Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as
| little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
| Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
| the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall
| receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso
| shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it
| were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
| and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the
| world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences
| come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! Wherefore
| if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast
| them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt
| or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast
| into everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it
| out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
| life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into
| hell fire. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little
| ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always
| behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
|
| _To use the prayers that follow_:
|
| O heavenly Father, whose face the angels of the little ones do
| always behold in heaven: Grant us stedfastly to believe that
| this little child hath been taken into the safe keeping of thine
| eternal love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.
|
| O Lord Jesu Christ, who didst take little children into thine
| arms and bless them: Open thou our eyes, we beseech thee, that
| we may perceive that thou hast now taken this child into the
| arms of thy love, and hast bestowed upon _him_ the blessings of
| thy gracious favour; who livest and reignest with the Father and
| the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. _Amen_.
|
| We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath
| pleased thee to regenerate this child with thy Holy Spirit, to
| receive _him_ for thine own by adoption, and to incorporate _him_
| into thy holy Church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant that,
| as _he_ is made partaker of the death of thy Son, _he_ may also
| be partaker of his resurrection; so that finally, with the
| residue of thy holy Church, _he_ may be an inheritor of thine
| everlasting kingdom; through Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE THANKSGIVING OF WOMEN AFTER CHILD-BIRTH,

COMMONLY CALLED THE CHURCHING OF WOMEN


_The woman, at the usual time after her delivery, shall come
into the Church decently apparelled, and there shall kneel down
in some convenient place, as hath been accustomed, or as the
Ordinary shall direct: And then the Priest shall say unto her_,

Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his goodness to
give you safe deliverance, and hath preserved you in the great
danger of child-birth: You shall therefore give hearty thanks
unto God, and say,

_Then shall the Priest say the cxvi. Psalm_.

_Dilexi quoniam_.

I am well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer;

That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live.

The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of
hell gat hold upon me.

I found trouble and heaviness, and I called upon the name of the
Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful.

The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.

Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath
rewarded thee.

And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling.

I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled:
I said in my haste, All men are liars.

What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that
he hath done unto me?

I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the name of the
Lord.

I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: in the
courts of the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
Praise the Lord.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Or Psalm cxxvii_.

_Nisi Dominus_.

Except the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that
build it.

Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.

It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late
take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his
beloved sleep.

Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift
that cometh of the Lord.

Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young
children.

Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not
be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Then the Priest shall say_,

Let us pray.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed  be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power,
and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.

_Minister_. O Lord, save this woman thy servant;

_Answer_. Who putteth her trust in thee.

_Minister_. Be thou to her a strong tower;

_Answer_. From the face of her enemy.

_Minister_. Lord, hear our prayer.

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

_Minister_.

Let us pray.

O almighty God, we give thee humble thanks for that thou hast
vouchsafed to deliver this woman thy servant from the great pain
and peril of child-birth: Grant, we beseech thee, most merciful
Father, that she through thy help may both faithfully live and
walk according to thy will, in this life present; and also may be
partaker of everlasting glory in the life to come; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_The woman, that cometh to give her thanks, must offer accustomed
offerings; and, if there be a Communion, it is convenient that she
receive the holy Communion_.




A COMMINATION,

OR DENOUNCING OF GOD'S ANGER AND

JUDGEMENTS AGAINST SINNERS,

WITH CERTAIN PRAYERS,

TO BE USED ON THE FIRST DAY OF LENT, AND AT OTHER

TIMES AS THE ORDINARY SHALL APPOINT


_After Morning Prayer, the Litany ended, according to the accustomed
manner, the Priest shall in the reading Pew or Pulpit say_,

Brethren, in the primitive Church there was a godly discipline,
that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted
of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished in this
world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and
that others, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid
to offend.

Instead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored again,
(which is much to be wished,) it is thought good that at this time
(in the presence of you all) should be read the general sentences
of God's cursing against impenitent sinners, gathered out of the
seven and twentieth chapter of Deuteronomy, and other places of
Scripture; and that ye should answer to every sentence, Amen: To
the intent that, being admonished of the great indignation of God
against sinners, ye may the rather be moved to earnest and true
repentance; and may walk more warily in these dangerous days;
fleeing from such vices, for which ye affirm with your own mouths
the curse of God to be due. Cursed is the man that maketh any
carved or molten image, to worship it.

_And the people shall answer and say_,

Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that curseth his father or mother.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that removeth his neighbour's  land-mark.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that maketh the blind to go out of his way.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that perverteth the judgement of the
stranger, the fatherless, and widow.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that smiteth his neighbour secretly.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that lieth with his neighbour's wife.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that taketh reward to slay the innocent.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, and
taketh man for his defence, and in his heart goeth from the Lord.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_. Cursed are the unmerciful, fornicators, and adulterers,
covetous persons, idolaters, slanderers, drunkards, and
extortioners.

_Answer_. Amen.

_Minister_.

Now seeing that all they are accursed (as the prophet David
beareth witness) who do err and go astray from the commandments
of God; let us (remembering the dreadful judgement hanging over
our heads, and always ready to fall upon us) return unto our Lord
God with all contrition and meekness of heart; bewailing and
lamenting our sinful life, acknowledging and confessing our
offences, and seeking to bring forth worthy fruits of penance.
For now is the axe put unto the root of the trees, so that every
tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
into the fire. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God: He shall pour down rain upon the sinners, snares, fire
and brimstone, storm and tempest; this shall be their portion to
drink. For lo, the Lord is come out of his place to visit the
wickedness of such as dwell upon the earth. But who may abide the
day of his coming? Who shall be able to endure when he appeareth?
His fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and gather his
wheat into the barn; but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable
fire. The day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night: and when
men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden
destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing
with child, and they shall not escape. Then shall appear the wrath
of God in the day of vengeance, which obstinate sinners, through
the stubbornness of their heart, have heaped unto themselves; which
despised the goodness, patience, and long-sufferance of God, when
he calleth them continually to repentance. Then shall they call
upon me (saith the Lord) but I will not hear; they shall seek me
early, but they shall not find me; and that, because they hated
knowledge, and received not the fear of the Lord, but abhorred my
counsel, and despised my correction. Then shall it be too late to
knock, when the door shall be shut; and too late to cry for mercy,
when it is the time of justice. O terrible voice of most just
judgement, which shall be pronounced upon them, when it shall be
said unto them, Go, ye cursed, into the fire everlasting, which
is prepared for the devil and his angels. Therefore, brethren,
take we heed betime, while the day of salvation lasteth; for the
night cometh, when none can work: But let us, while we have the
light, believe in the light, and walk as children of the light;
that we be not cast into utter darkness, where is weeping and
gnashing of teeth. Let us not abuse the goodness of God, who
calleth us mercifully to amendment, and of his endless pity
promiseth us forgiveness of that which is past, if with a perfect
and true heart we return unto him. For though our sins be as red
as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow; and though they be
like purple, yet they shall be made white as wool. Turn ye (saith
the Lord) from all your wickedness, and your sin shall not be your
destruction: Cast away from you all your ungodliness that ye have
done: Make you new hearts, and a new spirit: Wherefore will ye
die, O ye house of Israel? seeing that I have no pleasure in the
death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God. Turn ye then, and ye
shall live. Although we have sinned, yet have we an Advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation
for our sins. For he was wounded for our offences, and smitten for
our wickedness. Let us therefore return unto him, who is the
merciful receiver of all true penitent sinners; assuring ourselves
that he is ready to receive us, and most willing to pardon us, if
we come unto him with faithful repentance; if we submit ourselves
unto him, and from henceforth walk in his ways; if we will take
his easy yoke and light burden upon us, to follow him in lowliness,
patience, and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his
Holy Spirit; seeking always his glory, and serving him duly in our
vocation with thanksgiving. This if we do, Christ will deliver us
from the curse of the law, and from the extreme malediction which
shall light upon them that shall be set on the left hand; and he
will set us on his right hand, and give us the gracious benediction
of his Father, commanding us to take possession of his glorious
kingdom: Unto which he vouchsafe to bring us all, for his infinite
mercy. Amen.

_Then shall they all kneel upon their knees, and the Priest and
Clerks kneeling_ (_in the place where they are accustomed to say
the Litany_) _shall say this Psalm_.

_Miserere mei, Deus_. Psalm li.

Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according
to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.

Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.

For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.

Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight:
that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou
art judged.

Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother
conceived me.

But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make
me to understand wisdom secretly.

Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.

Turn thy face away from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.

Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit
from me.

O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy
free Spirit.

Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.

Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of
my health: and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.

Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.

For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou
delightest not in burnt-offering.

The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.

O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of
Jerusalem.

Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,
with the burnt-offerings and oblations: then shall they offer
young bullocks upon thine altar.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

_Answer_. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
world without end. Amen.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Minister_. O Lord, save thy servants;

_Answer_. That put their trust in thee.

_Minister_. Send unto them help from above.

_Answer_. And evermore mightily defend them.

_Minister_. Help us, O God our Saviour.

_Answer_. And for the glory of thy Name deliver us; be merciful
unto us sinners, for thy Name's sake.

_Minister_. O Lord, hear our prayer.

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

_Minister_.

Let us pray.

O Lord, we beseech thee, mercifully hear our prayers, and spare
all those who confess their sins unto thee; that they, whose
consciences by sin are accused, by thy merciful pardon may be
absolved; through Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

O most mighty God, and merciful Father, who hast compassion upon
all men, and hatest nothing that thou hast made; who wouldest not
the death of a sinner, but that he should rather turn from his sin,
and be saved: Mercifully forgive us our trespasses; receive and
comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the burden of our
sins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it
appertaineth to forgive sins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, spare
thy people, whom thou hast redeemed; enter not into judgement with
thy servants, who are vile earth, and miserable sinners; but so
turn thine anger from us, who meekly acknowledge our vileness, and
truly repent us of our faults, and so make haste to help us in
this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the people say this that followeth, after the Minister_.

Turn thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned. Be favourable,
O Lord, Be favourable to thy people, Who turn to thee in weeping,
fasting, and praying. For thou art a merciful God, Full of
compassion, long-suffering, and of great pity. Thou sparest when
we deserve punishment, And in thy wrath thinkest upon mercy. Spare
thy people, good Lord, spare them, And let not thine heritage be
brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, And
after the multitude of thy mercies look upon us; Through the merits
and mediation of thy blessed Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then the Minister alone shall say_,

The Lord bless us, and keep us; the Lord lift up the light of his
countenance upon us, and give us peace, now and for evermore.
_Amen_.




THE PSALMS OF DAVID


DAY 1 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 1. _Beatus vir, qui non abiit, &c_.

Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the
seat of the scornful.

2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will
he exercise himself day and night.

3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will
bring forth his fruit in due season.

4 His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth,
it shall prosper.

5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like
the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.

6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgement:
neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

7 But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of
the ungodly shall perish.

PSALM 2. _Quare fremuerunt gentes?_

Why do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the
people imagine a vain thing?

2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel
together: against the Lord, and against his Anointed.

3 Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords
from us.

4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord
shall have them in derision.

5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in
his sore displeasure.

6 Yet have I set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.

7 I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me:
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance: and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.

9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in
pieces like a potter's vessel.

10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are
judges of the earth.

11 Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the
right way: if his wrath be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed
are all they that put their trust in him.

PSALM 3. _Domine, quid multiplicati?_

Lord, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that
rise against me.

2 Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him
in his God.

3 But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the
lifter up of my head.

4 I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of
his holy hill.

5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord
sustained me.

6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have
set themselves against me round about.

7 Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine
enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
ungodly.

8 Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy
people.

PSALM 4. _Cum invocarem_.

Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at
liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto
my prayer.

2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and
have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?

3 Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that
is godly: when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.

4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in
your chamber, and be still.

5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the
Lord.

6 There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?

7 Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.

8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their
corn and wine and oil increased.

9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou,
Lord, only, that makest me dwell in safety.

PSALM 5. _Verba mea auribus_.

Ponder my words, O Lord: consider my meditation.

2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God:
for unto thee will I make my prayer.

3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither
shall any evil dwell with thee.

5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest
all them that work vanity.

6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor
both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.

7 But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the
multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy
holy temple.

8 Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies:
make thy way plain before my face.

9 For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are
very wickedness.

10 Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their
tongue.

11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own
imaginations: cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
for they have rebelled against thee.

12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they
shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they
that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;

13 For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and
with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.

DAY 1 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 6. _Domine, ne in furore_.

O Lord, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in
thy displeasure.

2 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak:

Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed.

3 My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou
punish me?

4 Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy
mercy's sake.

5 For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee
thanks in the pit?

6 I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water
my couch with my tears.

7 My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of
all mine enemies.

8 Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard
the voice of my weeping.

9 The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.

10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they
shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.

PSALM 7. _Domine, Deus meus_.

O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all
them that persecute me, and deliver me;

2 Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces:
while there is none to help.

3 O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be
any wickedness in my hands;

4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me:
yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;

5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let
him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in
the dust.

6 Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of
the indignation of mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement
that thou hast commanded.

7 And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for
their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.

8 The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord:
according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that
is in me.

9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide
thou the just.

10 For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.

11 My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of
heart.

12 God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is
provoked every day.

13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent
his bow, and made it ready.

14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth
his arrows against the persecutors.

15 Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow,
and brought forth ungodliness.

16 He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen himself into
the destruction that he made for other.

17 For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness
shall fall on his own pate.

18 I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness:
and I will praise the Name of the Lord most High.

PSALM 8. _Domine, Dominus noster_.

O Lord our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world:
thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!

2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength, because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the
enemy and the avenger.

3 For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers:
the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.

4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man,
that thou visitest him?

5 Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory
and worship.

6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet;

7 All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;

8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever
walketh through the paths of the seas.

9 O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

DAY 2 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 9. _Confitebor tibi_.

I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will
speak of all thy marvellous works.

2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of
thy Name, O thou most Highest.

3 While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish
at thy presence.

4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in
the throne that judgest right.

5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou
hast put out their name forever and ever.

6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as
the cities which thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished
with them.

7 But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his
seat for judgement.

8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true
judgement unto the people.

9 The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge
in due time of trouble.

10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for
thou, Lord, hast never failed them that seek thee.

11 O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: shew the people of
his doings.

12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them:
and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.

13 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer
of them that hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of
death.

14 That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter
of Sion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same
net which they hid privily, is their foot taken.

16 The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped
in the work of his own hands.

17 The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that
forget God.

18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten: the patient abiding
of the meek shall not perish for ever.

19 Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen
be judged in thy sight.

20 Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves
to be but men.

PSALM 10. _Ut quid, Domine?_

Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the
needful time of trouble?

2 The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them
be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.

3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and
speaketh good of the covetous, whom God abhorreth.

4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God: neither is
God in all his thoughts.

5 His ways are alway grievous: thy judgements are far above out of
his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.

6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down:
there shall no harm happen unto me.

7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue
is ungodliness and vanity.

8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and
privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes
are set against the poor.

9 For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his
den: that he may ravish the poor.

10 He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.

11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of
the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.

12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth
away his face, and he will never see it.

13 Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.

14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in
his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it.

15 Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and
wrong.

16 That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor
committeth himself unto thee; for thou art the helper of the
friendless.

17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away
his ungodliness, and thou shalt find none.

18 The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished
out of the land.

19 Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest
their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth thereto;

20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man
of the earth be no more exalted against them.

PSALM 11. _In Domino confido_.

In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she
should flee as a bird unto the hill?

2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows
within the quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are
true of heart.

3 For the foundations will be cast down: and what hath the righteous
done?

4 The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.

5 His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try. the children
of men.

6 The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that
delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.

7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm
and tempest: this shall be their portion to drink.

8 For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance
will behold the thing that is just.

DAY 2 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 12. _Salvum me fac_.

Help me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the
faithful are minished from among the children of men.

2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but
flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.

3 The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that
speaketh proud things;

4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they
that ought to speak, who is lord over us?

5 Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because
of the deep sighing of the poor,

6 I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that
swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.

7 The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which
from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.

8 Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this
generation for ever.

9 The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the
children of men are put to rebuke.

PSALM 13. _Usquequo, Domine?_

How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou
hide thy face from me?

2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my
heart: how long shall mine enemies triumph over me?

3 Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I
sleep not in death.

4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be
cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.

5 But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy
salvation.

6 I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with
me: yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.

PSALM 14. _Dixit insipiens_.

The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.

2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there
is none that doeth good, no not one.

3 The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to
see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.

4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable: there is none that doeth good, no not one.

5 Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they
deceived: the poison of asps is under their lips.

6 Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are
swift to shed blood.

7 Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of
peace have they not known: there is no fear of God before their
eyes.

8 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of
mischief: eating up my people as it were bread, and call not
upon the Lord?

9 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was:
for God is in the generation of the righteous.

10 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor:
because he putteth his trust in the Lord.

11 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the
Lord turneth the captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.

DAY 3 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 15. _Domine, quis habitabit?_

Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon
thy holy hill?

2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing
which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.

3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to
his neighbour: and hath not slandered his neighbour.

4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes:
and maketh much of them that fear the Lord.

5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not:
though it were to his own hindrance.

6 He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward
against the innocent. Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.

PSALM 16. _Conserva me, Domine_.

Preserve me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.

2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my
goods are nothing unto thee.

3 All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and
upon such as excel in virtue.

4 But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.

5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make
mention of their names within my lips.

6 The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my
cup: thou shalt maintain my lot.

7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly
heritage.

8 I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also
chasten me in the night-season.

9 I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand,
therefore I shall not fall.

10 Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh
also shall rest in hope.

11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt
thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.

12 Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the
fulness of joy: and at thy right hand there is pleasure for
evermore.

PSALM 17. _Exaudi, Domine_.

Hear the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto
my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes
look upon the thing that is equal.

3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season;
thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me: for I am
utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.

4 Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy
lips: I have kept me from the ways of the destroyer.

5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.

6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline
thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.

7 Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour
of them which put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy
right hand.

8 Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy
wings,

9 From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round
about to take away my soul.

10 They are inclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh
proud things.

11 They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes
down to the ground;

12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a
lion's whelp, lurking in secret places.

13 Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul
from the ungodly, which is a sword of thine;

14 From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and
from the evil world: which have their portion in this life, whose
bellies thou fillest with thy hid treasure.

15 They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of
their substance for their babes.

16 But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and
when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.

DAY 3 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 18. _Diligam te, Domine_.

I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock,
and my defence: my Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will
trust, my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.

2 I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so
shall I be safe from mine enemies.

3 The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of
ungodliness made me afraid.

4 The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.

5 In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.

6 So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my
complaint shall come before him, it shall enter even into his ears.

7 The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the
hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.

8 There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out
of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.

9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under
his feet.

10 He rode upon the cherubins, and did fly: he came flying upon the
wings of the wind.

11 He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him,
with dark water and thick clouds to cover him.

12 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones,
and coals of fire.

13 The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his
thunder: hail-stones, and coals of fire.

14 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth
lightnings, and destroyed them.

15 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the
round world were discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the
blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.

16 He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me
out of many waters.

17 He shall deliver me from my strongest enemy, and from them
which hate me: for they are too mighty for me.

18 They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was
my upholder.

19 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought
me forth, even because he had a favour unto me.

20 The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according
to the cleanness of my hands shall he recompense me.

21 Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken
my God, as the wicked doth.

22 For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his
commandments from me.

23 I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.

24 Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing:
and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.

25 With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou
shalt be perfect.

26 With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou
shalt learn frowardness.

27 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt
bring down the high looks of the proud.

28 Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my
darkness to be light.

29 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help
of my God I shall leap over the wall.

30 The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is
tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that put their
trust in him.

31 For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except
our God?

32 It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my
way perfect.

33 He maketh my feet like harts feet: and setteth me up on high.

34 He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even
a bow of steel.

35 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation: thy right hand
also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me
great.

36 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my
footsteps shall not slide.

37 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither
will I turn again till I have destroyed them.

38 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but
fall under my feet.

39 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt
throw down mine enemies under me.

40 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me:
and I shall destroy them that hate me.

41 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even
unto the Lord shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.

42 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will
cast them out as the clay in the streets.

43 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and
thou shalt make me the head of the heathen.

44 A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.

45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange
children shall dissemble with me.

46 The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their
prisons.

47 The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised
be the God of my salvation;

48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the
people unto me.

49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth
me up above mine adversaries:  thou shalt rid me from the wicked
man.

50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the
Gentiles: and sing praises unto thy Name.

51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and sheweth
loving-kindness unto David his Anointed, and unto his seed for
evermore.

DAY 4 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 19. _Caeli enarrant_.

The heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth
his handywork.

2 One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.

3 There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are
heard among them.

4 Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into
the ends of the world.

5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh
forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a
giant to run his course.

6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and
runneth about unto the end of it again: and there is nothing
hid from the heat thereof.

7 The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul:
the testimony of the Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the
simple.

8 The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the
commandment of the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.

9 The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the
judgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.

10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey, and the honey-comb.

11 Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them
there is great reward.

12 Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my
secret faults.

13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the
dominion over me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the
great offence.

14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart: be
alway acceptable in thy sight,

15 O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.

PSALM 20. _Exaudiat te Dominus_.

The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of
Jacob defend thee;

2 Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of
Sion;

3 Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt-sacrifice;

4 Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.

5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of
the Lord our God: the Lord perform all thy petitions.

6 Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear
him from his holy heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his
right hand.

7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we
will remember the Name of the Lord our God.

8 They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
upright.

9 Save, Lord, and hear us, O King of heaven; when we call upon thee.

PSALM 21. _Domine, in virtute tua_.

The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad
shall he be of thy salvation.

2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him
the request of his lips.

3 For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and
shalt set a crown of pure gold upon his head.

4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for
ever and ever.

5 His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship
shalt thou lay upon him.

6 For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad
with the joy of thy countenance.

7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in
the mercy of the most Highest he shall not miscarry.

8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall
find out them that hate thee.

9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath:
the Lord shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall
consume them.

10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed
from among the children of men.

11 For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a
device as they are not able to perform.

12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy
bow shalt thou make ready against the face of them.

13 Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so will we sing,
and praise thy power.

DAY 4 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 22. _Deus, Deus meus_.

O my God, my God, look upon me; why hast  thou forsaken me: and
art so far from my health, and from the words of my complaint?

2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in
the night-season also I take no rest.

3 And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.

4 Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst
deliver them.

5 They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in
thee, and were not confounded.

6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and
the outcast of the people.

7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out their
lips, and shake their heads, saying,

8 He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver
him, if he will have him.

9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast
my hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.

10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my
God, even from my mother's womb.

11 O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is
none to help me.

12 Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on
every side.

13 They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and
a roaring lion.

14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
my heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.

15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth
to my gums: and thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.

16 For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked
layeth siege against me.

17`They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones:
they stand staring and looking upon me.

18 They part my garments among them: and cast lots upon my vesture.

19 But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour,
haste thee to help me.

20 Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of
the dog.

21 Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from
among the horns of the unicorns.

22 I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee.

23 O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of
the seed of Jacob, and fear him, all ye seed of Israel;

24 For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the
poor: he hath not hid his face from him, but when he called unto
him he heard him.

25 My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will
I perform in the sight of them that fear him.

26 The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the
Lord shall praise him; your heart shall live for ever.

27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be
turned unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before him.

28 For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among
the people.

29 All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.

30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him:
and no man hath quickened his own soul.

31 My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord
for a generation.

32 They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness:
unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.

PSALM 23. _Dominus regit me_.

The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.

2 He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside
the waters of comfort.

3 He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness, for his Name's sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
comfort me.

5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble
me: thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.

6 But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

DAY 5 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 24. _Domini est terra_.

The earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of
the world, and they that dwell therein.

2 For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the
floods.

3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise
up in his holy place?

4 Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not
lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.

5 He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness
from the God of his salvation.

6 This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that
seek thy face, O Jacob.

7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors: and the King of glory shall come in.

8 Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even
the Lord mighty in battle.

9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors: and the King of glory shall come in.

10 Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the
King of glory.

PSALM 25. _Ad te, Domine, levavi_.

Unto thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put
my trust in thee: O let me not be confounded, neither let mine
enemies triumph over me.

2 For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such
as transgress without a cause shall be put to confusion.

3 Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.

4 Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God
of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.

5 Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy
loving-kindnesses, which have been ever of old.

6 O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according
to thy mercy think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.

7 Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach
sinners in the way.

8 Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are
gentle, them shall he learn his way.

9 All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies.

10 For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is
great.

11 What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose.

12 His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the
land.

13 The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will
shew them his covenant.

14 Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my
feet out of the net.

15 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate
and in misery.

16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
my troubles.

17 Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.

18 Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a
tyrannous hate against me.

19 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for
I have put my trust in thee.

20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope
hath been in thee.

21 Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.

PSALM 26. _Judica me, Domine_.

Be thou my Judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust
hath been also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.

2 Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.

3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will
walk in thy truth.

4 I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship
with the deceitful.

5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit
among the ungodly.

6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to
thine altar; 7 That I may shew the voice of thanksgiving: and tell
of all thy wondrous works.

8 Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place
where thine honour dwelleth.

9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the
blood-thirsty;

10 In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of
gifts.

11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be
merciful unto me.

12 My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the
congregations.

PSALM 27. _Dominus illuminatio_.

The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom I then shall I fear:
the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?

2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to
eat up my flesh: they stumbled and fell.

3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my
heart be afraid: and though there rose up war against me, yet will
I put my trust in him.

4 One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
to behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and to visit his temple.

5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle:
yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set
me up upon a rock of stone.

6 And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round
about me.

7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great
gladness: I will sing, and speak praises unto the Lord.

8 Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy
upon me, and hear me.

9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord,
will I seek.

10 O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in
displeasure.

11 Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O
God of my salvation,

12 When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.

13 Teach me thy way, O Lord: and lead me in the right way, because
of mine enemies.

14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there
are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.

15 I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see
the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.

16 O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall
comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the Lord.

PSALM 28. _Ad te, Domine_.

Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my strength:  think no scorn of me;
lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them
that go down into the pit.

2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when
I hold up my hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.

3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and
wicked doers: which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine
mischief in their hearts.

4 Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the
wickedness of their own inventions.

5 Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they
have deserved.

6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the
operation of his hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not
build them up.

7 Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble
petitions.

8 The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in
him, and I am helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in
my song will I praise him.

9 The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his
Anointed.

10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance:
feed them, and set them up for ever.

PSALM 29. _Afferte Domino_.

Bring unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord:
ascribe unto the Lord worship and strength.

2 Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with
holy worship.

3 It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious
God that maketh the thunder.

4 It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is
mighty in operation: the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.

5 The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord
breaketh the cedars of Libanus.

6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and
Sirion, like a young unicorn.

7 The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice
of the Lord shaketh the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the
wilderness of Cades.

8 The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and
discovereth the thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak
of his honour.

9 The Lord sitteth above the water-flood: and the Lord remaineth
a King for ever.

10 The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall
give his people the blessing of peace.

DAY 6 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 30. _Exaltobo te, Domine_.

I will magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made
my foes to triumph over me.

2 O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.

3 Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept
my life from them that go down to the pit.

4 Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks
unto him for a remembrance of his holiness.

5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his
pleasure is life: heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh
in the morning.

6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou,
Lord, of thy goodness hast made my hill so strong.

7 Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.

8 Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right
humbly.

9 What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?

10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy
truth?

11 Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.

12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.

13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without
ceasing: O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

PSALM 31. _In te, Domine, speravi_.

In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to
confusion, deliver me in thy righteousness.

2 Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.

3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou
mayest save me.

4 For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my
guide, and lead me for thy Name's sake.

5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
thou art my strength.

6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me,
O Lord, thou God of truth.

7 I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my
trust hath been in the Lord.

8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered
my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.

9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast
set my feet in a large room.

10 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: and mine eye
is consumed for very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.

11 For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with
mourning.

12 My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones
are consumed.

13 I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially
among my neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of
me; and they that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.

14 I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become
like a broken vessel.

15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on
every side, while they conspire together against me, and take their
counsel to take away my life.

16 But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art
my God.

17 My time is in thy hand, deliver me from the hand of mine enemies:
and from them that persecute me.

18 Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for
thy mercy's sake.

19 Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee:
let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the
grave.

20 Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully,
and despitefully, speak against the righteous.

21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for
them that fear thee: and that thou hast prepared for them that put
their trust in thee, even before the sons of men!

22 Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the
provoking of all men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy
tabernacle from the strife of tongues.

23 Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great
kindness in a strong city.

24 And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of
thine eyes.

25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried
unto thee.

26 O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth
them that are faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.

27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all ye that put
your trust in the Lord.

DAY 6 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 32. _Beati quorum_.

Blessed is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is
covered.

2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in
whose spirit there is no guile.

3 For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my
daily complaining.

4 For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is
like the drought in summer.

5 I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness
have I not hid.

6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou
forgavest the wickedness of my sin.

7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto
thee, in a time when thou mayest be found: but in the great
water-floods they shall not come nigh him.

8 Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from
trouble: thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.

9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt
go: and I will guide thee with mine eye.

10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding:
whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, lest they fall upon
thee.

11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his
trust in the Lord, mercy embraceth him on every side.

12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful,
all ye that are true of heart.

PSALM 33. _Exultate, justi_.

Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just
to be thankful.

2 Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute,
and instrument of ten strings.

3 Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him
with a good courage.

4 For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.

5 He loveth righteousness, and judgement: the earth is full of the
goodness of the Lord.

6 By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts
of them by the breath of his mouth.

7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an
heap: and layeth up the deep, as in a treasure-house.

8 Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye
that dwell in the world.

9 For he spake, and it was done: he commanded, and it stood fast.

10 The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and
maketh the devices of the people to be of none effect, and casteth
out the counsels of princes.

11 The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts
of his heart from generation to generation.

12 Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and
blessed are the folk, that he hath chosen to him, to be his
inheritance.

13 The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children
of men: from the habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them
that dwell on the earth.

14 He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all
their works.

15 There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host:
neither is any mighty man delivered by much strength.

16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall
he deliver any man by his great strength.

17 Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and
upon them that put their trust in his mercy;

18 To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time
of dearth.

19 Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help
and our shield.

20 For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his
holy Name.

21 Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do
put our trust in thee.

PSALM 34. _Benedicam Dominum_.

I will alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be
in my mouth.

2 My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad.

3 O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.

4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of
all my fear.

5 They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces
were not ashamed.

6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth
him out of all his troubles.

7 The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him:
and delivereth them.

8 O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man
that trusteth in him.

9 O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him
lack nothing.

10 The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the
Lord shall want no manner of thing that is good.

11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the
fear of the Lord.

12 What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good
days?

13 Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no
guile.

14 Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.

15 The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are
open unto their prayers.

16 The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to
root out the remembrance of them from the earth.

17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth
them out of all their troubles.

18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and
will save such as be of an humble spirit.

19 Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth
him out of all.

20 He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.

21 But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the
righteous shall be desolate.

22 The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they
that put their trust in him shall not be destitute.

DAY 7 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 35. _Judica, Domine_.

Plead thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and
fight thou against them that fight against me.

2 Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.

3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that
persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

4 Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul:
let them be turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine
mischief for me.

5 Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the
Lord scattering them.

6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
Lord persecute them.

7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a
cause: yea, even without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.

8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net,
that he hath laid privily, catch himself: that he may fall into
his own mischief.

9 And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his
salvation.

10 All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him: yea, the
poor, and him that is in misery, from him that spoileth him?

11 False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that
I knew not.

12 They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my
soul.

13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and
humbled my soul with fasting: and my prayer shall turn into mine
own bosom.

14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother:
I went heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
together: yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares,
making mouths at me, and ceased not.

16 With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me
with their teeth.

17 Lord, how long wilt thou look upon this: O deliver my soul
from the calamities which they bring on me, and my darling from
the lions.

18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
praise thee among much people.

19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly:
neither let them wink with their eyes that hate me without a cause.

20 And why? their communing is not for peace: but they imagine
deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.

21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee,
fie on thee, we saw it with our eyes.

22 This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not
far from me, O Lord.

23 Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause,
my God, and my Lord.

24 Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and
let them not triumph over me.

25 Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we
have it: neither let them say, We have devoured him.

26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice
at my trouble: let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that
boast themselves against me.

27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing:
yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in
the prosperity of his servant.

28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness:
and of thy praise all the day long.

PSALM 36. _Dixit injustus_.

My heart sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is
no fear of God before his eyes.

2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable
sin be found out.

3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he
hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.

4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no
good way: neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.

5 Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness
unto the clouds.

6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy
judgements are like the great deep.

7 Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy
mercy, O God: and the children of men shall put their trust under
the shadow of thy wings.

8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and
thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.

9 For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see
light.

10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee:
and thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.

11 O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the
hand of the ungodly cast me down.

12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast
down, and shall not be able to stand.

DAY 7 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 37. _Noli aemulari_.

Fret not thyself because of the ungodly 2 neither be thou envious
against the evil-doers,

2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered
even as the green herb.

3 Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the
land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

4 Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's
desire.

5 Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he
shall bring it to pass.

6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light: and thy
just dealing as the noon-day.

7 Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but
grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper, against the man
that doeth after evil counsels.

8 Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself,
else shalt thou be moved to do evil.

9 Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide
the Lord, those shall inherit the land.

10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou
shalt look after his place, and he shall be away.

11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be
refreshed in the multitude of peace.

12 The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon
him with his teeth.

13 The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day
is coming.

14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow:
to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right
conversation.

15 Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow
shall be broken.

16 A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great
riches of the ungodly.

17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord
upholdeth the righteous.

18 The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance
shall endure for ever.

19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the
days of dearth they shall have enough.

20 As for the ungodly; they shall perish; and the enemies of the
Lord shall consume as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke
shall they consume away.

21 The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
is merciful and liberal.

22 Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that
are cursed of him shall be rooted out.

23 The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way
acceptable to himself.

24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord
upholdeth him with his hand.

25 I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.

26 The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is
blessed.

27 Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for
evermore.

28 For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not
his that be godly, but they are preserved for ever.

29 The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the
ungodly, it shall be rooted out.

30 The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein for ever.

31 The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his
tongue will be talking of judgement.

32 The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not
slide.

33 The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay
him.

34 The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when
he is judged.

35 Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote
thee, that thou shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall
perish, thou shalt see it.

36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing
like a green bay-tree.

37 I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place
could no where be found.

38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for
that shall bring a man peace at the last.

39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the
end of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last.

40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is
also their strength in the time of trouble.

41 And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall
deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they
put their trust in him.

DAY 8 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 38. _Domine, ne in furore_.

Put me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me
in thy heavy displeasure.

2 For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.

3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure:
neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.

4 For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore
burden, too heavy for me to bear.

5 My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.

6 I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning
all the day long.

7 For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no
whole part in my body.

8 I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very
disquietness of my heart.

9 Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid
from thee.

10 My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the light of
mine eyes is gone from me.

11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble:
and my kinsmen stood afar off.

12 They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and
they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness, and
imagined deceit all the day long.

13 As for me, I was like a deaf man, and heard not: and as one
that is dumb, who doth not open his mouth.

14 I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth
are no reproofs.

15 For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for
me, O Lord my God.

161 have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph
over me: for when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.

17 And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever
in my sight.

18 For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.

19 But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me
wrongfully are many in number.

20 They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I
follow the thing that good is.

21 Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.

22 Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.

PSALM 39. _Dixi, Custodiam_.

I said, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.

2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly
is in my sight.

3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even
from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.

4 My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire
kindled: and at the last I spake with my tongue;

5 Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I
may be certified how long I have to live.

6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine
age is even as nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man
living is altogether vanity.

7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in
vain: he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.

8 And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.

9 Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto
the foolish.

10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.

11 Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means
of thy heavy hand.

12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest
his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a
garment: every man therefore is but vanity.

13 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling:
hold not thy peace at my tears.

14 For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my
fathers were.

15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I
go hence, and be no more seen.

PSALM 40. _Expectans expectavi_.

I waited patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and
heard my calling.

2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and
clay: and set my feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.

3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto
our God.

4 Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the
Lord.

5 Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned
not unto the proud, and to such as go about with lies.

6 O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast
done, like as be also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet
there is no man that ordereth them unto thee.

7 If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more
than I am able to express.

8 Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears
hast thou opened.

9 Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required:
then said I, Lo, I come,

10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should
fulfil thy will, O my God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is
within my heart.

11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation:
lo, I will not refrain my lips, Lord, and that thou knowest.

12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath
been of thy truth and of thy salvation.

13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great
congregation.

14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy
loving-kindness and thy truth alway preserve me.

15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken
such hold upon me that

I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.

16 O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O
Lord, to help me.

17 Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after
my soul to destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to
rebuke, that wish me evil.

18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto
me, Fie upon thee, fie upon thee.

19 Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and
let such as love thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.

20 As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.

21 Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.

DAY 8 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 41. _Beatus qui intelligit_.

Blessed is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall
deliver him in the time of trouble.

2 The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed
upon earth: and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.

3 The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make
thou all his bed in his sickness.

4 I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have
sinned against thee.

5 Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name
perish?

6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart
conceiveth falsehood within himself, and when he cometh forth he
telleth it.

7 All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me
do they imagine this evil.

8 Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that
he lieth, let him rise up no more.

9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did
also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.

10 But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again,
and I shall reward them.

11 By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not
triumph against me.

12 And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set
me before thy face for ever.

13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.

PSALM 42. _Quemadmodum_.

Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul
after thee, O God.

2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when
shall I come to appear before the presence of God?

3 My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say
unto me, Where is now thy God?

4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I
went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of
God;

5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep
holy-day.

6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou
so disquieted within me?

7 Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the
help of his countenance.

8 My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember
thee concerning the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.

9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy water-pipes:
all thy waves and storms are gone over me.

1 The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and
in the night-season did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the
God of my life.

Ill will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten
me: why go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?

12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies
that trouble me cast me in the teeth;

13 Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?

14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?

15 O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the
help of my countenance, and my God.

PSALM 43. _Judica me, Deus_.

Give sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the
ungodly people: O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.

2 For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from
thee: and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?

3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and
bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling.

4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of
my joy and gladness: and upon the harp will I give thanks unto
thee, O God, my God.

5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?

6 O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which
is the help of my countenance, and my God

DAY 9 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 44. _Deus, auribus_.

We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what
thou hast done in their time of old;

2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted
them in: how thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.

3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword:
neither was it their own arm that helped them;

4 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy
countenance: because thou hadst a favour unto them.

5 Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.

6 Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name
will we tread them under, that rise up against us.

7 For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall
help me;

8 But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest
them to confusion that hate us.

9 We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name
for ever.

10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and
goest not forth with our armies.

11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they
which hate us spoil our goods.

12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us
among the heathen.

13 Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.

14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed
to scorn, and had in derision of them that are round about us.

15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the
people shake their heads at us.

16 My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath
covered me;

17 For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy
and avenger.

18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee:
nor behave ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.

19 Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy
way;

20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons:
and covered us with the shadow of death.

21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our
hands to any strange god: shall not God search it out? for he
knoweth the very secrets of the heart.

22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted
as sheep appointed to be slain.

23 Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us
for ever.

24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and
trouble?

25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly
cleaveth unto the ground.

26 Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.

PSALM 45. _Eructavit cor meum_.

My heart is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the things which
I have made unto the

2 My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.

3 Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy
lips, because God hath blessed thee for ever.

4 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty:
according to thy worship and renown.

5 Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the
word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand
shall teach thee terrible things.

6 Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto
thee: even in the midst among the King's enemies.

7 Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom
is a right sceptre.

8 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God,
even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.

9 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the
ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

10 Kings daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right
hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with
divers colours.

11 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear: forget
also thine own people, and thy father's house.

12 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for he is thy
Lord God, and worship thou him.

13 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as
the rich also among the people shall make their supplication before
thee.

14 The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
wrought gold.

15 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work:
the virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall
be brought unto thee.

16 With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter
into the King's palace.

17 Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou
mayest make princes in all lands.

18 I will remember thy Name from one generation to another:
therefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world without end.

PSALM 46. _Deus noster refugium_.

God is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.

2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though
the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;

3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains
shake at the tempest of the same.

4 The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God:
the holy place of the tabernacle of the most Highest.

5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed:
God shall help her, and that right early.

6 The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God
hath shewed his voice, and the earth shall melt away.

7 The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

8 O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction
he hath brought upon the earth.

9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow,
and knappeth the spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the
fire.

10 Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among
the heathen, and I will be exalted in the earth.

11 The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

DAY 9 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 47. _Omnes gentes, plaudite_.

O clap your hands together, all ye people: O sing unto God with
the voice of melody. 2 For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he
is the great King upon all the earth.

3 He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our
feet.

4 He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of
Jacob, whom he loved.

5 God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound
of the trump.

6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing
praises unto our King.

7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
understanding.

8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.

9 The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God
of Abraham: for God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the
earth, as it were with a shield.

PSALM 48. _Magnus Dominus_.

Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our
God, even upon his holy hill.

2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth:
upon the north-side lieth the city of the great King; God is well
known in her palaces as a sure refuge.

3 For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.

4 They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and
suddenly cast down.

5 Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her
travail.

6 Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east-wind.

7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord
of hosts, in the city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.

8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.

9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's
end: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughter of Judah be glad:
because of thy judgements.

11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers
thereof.

12 Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell
them that come after.

13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide
unto death.

PSALM 49. _Audite haec, omnes_.

O hear ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye
that dwell in the world;

2 High and low, rich and poor: one with another.

3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of
understanding.

4 I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech
upon the harp.

5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the
wickedness of my heels compasseth me round about?

6 There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches.

7 But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God
for him;

8 For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that
alone for ever;

9 Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.

10 For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as
well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other.

11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever:
and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to
another; and call the lands after their own names.

12 Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing he may be
compared unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.

13 This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their
saying.

14 They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and
the righteous shall have domination over them in the morning: their
beauty shall consume in the sepulchre out of their dwelling.

15 But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he
shall receive me.

16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of
his house be increased;

17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither
shall his pomp follow him.

18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so
long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.

19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never
see light.

20 Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto
the beasts that perish.

DAY 10 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 50. _Deus deorum_.

The Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the
world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.

2 Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.

3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go
before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred
up round about him.

4 He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may
judge his people.

5 Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a
covenant with me with sacrifice.

6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge
himself.

7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify
against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God.

8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy
burnt-offerings: because they were not alway before me.

9 I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of
thy folds.

10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle
upon a thousand hills.

11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts
of the field are in my sight.

12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is
mine, and all that is therein.

13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls flesh: and drink the blood
of goats?

14 Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most
Highest.

15 And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee,
and thou shalt praise me.

16 But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws,
and takest my covenant in thy mouth;

17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and hast cast my words
behind thee?

18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast
been partaker with the adulterers.

19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue
thou hast set forth deceit.

20 Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast
slandered thine own mother's son.

21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou
thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but
I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast
done.

22 O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and
there be none to deliver you.

23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him
that ordereth his conversation right will I shew the salvation of
God.

PSALM 51. _Miserere mei, Deus_.

Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to
the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.

2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.

3 For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.

4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight:
that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou
art judged.

5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother
conceived me.

6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make
me to understand wisdom secretly.

7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoice.

9 Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.

10 Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.

11 Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy
Spirit from me.

12 O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with
thy free Spirit.

13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall
be converted unto thee.

14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God
of my health: and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.

15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy
praise.

16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but
thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.

17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite
heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.

18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of
Jerusalem.

19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,
with the burnt-offerings and oblations: then shall they offer young
bullocks upon thine altar.

PSALM 52. _Quid gloriaris?_

Why boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;

2 Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?

3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like
a sharp rasor.

4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness: and to talk
of lies more than righteousness.

5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false
tongue.

6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee,
and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land
of the living.

7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him
to scorn;

8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but
trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself
in his wickedness.

9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my
trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.

10 I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done:
and I will hope in thy Name, for thy saints like it well.

DAY 10 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 53. _Dixit insipiens_.

The foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.

2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness:
there is none that doeth good.

3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if
there were any that would understand, and seek after God.

4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable: there is also none that doeth good, no not one.

5 Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating
up my people as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon
God.

6 They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones
of him that besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because
God hath despised them.

7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that
the Lord would deliver his people out of captivity!

8 Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.

PSALM 54. _Deus, in Nomine_.

Save me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.

2 Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.

3 For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have
not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.

4 Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul.

5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy
truth.

6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name,
O Lord: because it is so comfortable.

7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies.

PSALM 55. _Exaudi, Deus_.

Hear my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.

2 Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am
vexed.

3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they
are minded to do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set
against me.

4 My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen
upon me.

5 Tearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread
hath overwhelmed me.

6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee
away, and be at rest.

7 Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.

8 I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.

9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied
unrighteousness and strife in the city.

10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

11 Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of her streets.

12 For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour:
for then I could have borne it.

13 Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against
me: for then peradventure I would have hid myself from him.

14 But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own
familiar friend.

15 We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God
as friends.

16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick
into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

17 As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.

18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and
that instantly: and he shall hear my voice.

19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle
that was against me: for there were many with me.

20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring
them down: for they will not turn, nor fear God.

21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he
brake his covenant.

22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in
his heart: his words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very
swords.

23 O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and
shall not suffer the righteous to fall for ever.

24 And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of
destruction.

25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half
their days: nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

DAY 11 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 56. _Miserere met, Deus_.

Be merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is
daily fighting, and troubling me.

2 Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be
many that fight against me, thou most Highest.

3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in
thee.

4 I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in
God, and will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

5 They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me
evil.

6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my
steps, when they lay wait for my soul.

7 Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy
displeasure shalt cast them down.

8 Thou tellest my Sittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not
these things noted in thy book?

9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to
flight: this I know; for God is on my side.

10 In God's word will I rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort
me.

11 Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man
can do unto me.

12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give
thanks.

13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from
falling: that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

PSALM 57. _Miserere mei, Deus_.

Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul
trusteth in thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my
refuge, until this tyranny be over-past.

2 I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall
perform the cause which I have in hand.

3 He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him
that would eat me up.

4 God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.

5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire:
whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

6 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
all the earth.

7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they
have digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it
themselves.

8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and
give praise.

9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake
right early.

10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I
will sing unto thee among the nations.

11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and
thy truth unto the clouds.

12 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
all the earth.

PSALM 58. _Si vere utique_.

Are your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do
ye judge the thing that is right, O ye sons of men?

2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your
hands deal with wickedness.

3 The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon
as they are born, they go astray, and speak lies.

4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the
deaf adder that stoppeth her ears;

5 Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never
so wisely.

6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones
of the lions, O Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth
apace; and when they shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.

7 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely
fruit of a woman: and let them not see the sun.

8 Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation
vex him, even as a thing that is raw.

9 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall
wash his footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.

10 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
righteous: doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth.

DAY 11 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 59._ Eripe me de inimicis_.

Deliver me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise
up against me.

2 O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the
blood-thirsty men.

3 For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered
against me, without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.

4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou
therefore to help me, and behold.

5 Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all
the heathen: and be not merciful unto them that offend of malicious
wickedness.

6 They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run
about through the city.

7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their
lips: for who doth hear?

8 But thou, O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt
laugh all the heathen to scorn.

9 My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my
refuge.

10 God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me
see my desire upon mine enemies.

11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad
among the people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.

12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips,
they shall be taken in their pride: and why? their preaching is
of cursing and lies.

13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish:
and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of
the world.

14 And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will
go about the city.

15 They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be
not satisfied.

16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy
betimes in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
in the day of my trouble.

17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my
refuge, and my merciful God.

PSALM 60. _Deus, repulisti nos_.

O God, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast
also been displeased; O turn thee unto us again.

2 Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof,
for it shaketh.

3 Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a
drink of deadly wine.

4 Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may
triumph because of the truth.

5 Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right
hand, and hear me.

6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide
Sichem: and mete out the valley of Succoth.

7 Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the
strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;

8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,
be thou glad of me.

9 Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into
Edom?

10 Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out
with our hosts?

11 O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.

12 Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall
tread down our enemies.

PSALM 61. _Exaudi, Deus_.

Hear my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.

2 From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee: when my heart
is in heaviness.

3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast
been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.

4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be
under the covering of thy wings.

5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an
heritage unto those that fear thy Name.

6 Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure
throughout all generations.

7 He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy
and faithfulness, that they may preserve him.

8 So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily
perform my vows.

DAY 12 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 62. _Nonne Deo?_

My soul truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.

2 He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so
that I shall not greatly fall.

3 How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be
slain all the sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be,
and like a broken hedge.

4 Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt:
their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth,
but curse with their heart.

5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is
in him.

6 He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so
that I shall not fall.

7 In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in
God is my trust.

8 O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts
before him, for God is our hope.

9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of
men are deceitful upon the weights, they are altogether lighter
than vanity itself.

10 O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto
vanity: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

11 God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power
belongeth unto God;

1 2 And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every
man according to his work.

PSALM 63. _Deus, Deus meus_.

O God, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.

2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in
a barren and dry land where no water is.

3 Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy
power and glory.

4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips
shall praise thee.

5 As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up
my hands in thy Name.

6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and
fatness: when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.

7 Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when
I was waking?

8 Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of
thy wings will I rejoice.

9 My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.

10 These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under
the earth.

11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a
portion for foxes.

12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by
him shall be commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall
be stopped.

PSALM 64. _Exaudi, Deus_.

Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of
the enemy.

2 Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the
insurrection of wicked doers;

3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their
arrows, even bitter words;

4 That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do
they hit him, and fear not.

5 They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among
themselves how they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see
them.

6 They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret
among themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.

7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that
they shall be wounded.

8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall: insomuch that whoso
seeth them shall laugh them to scorn.

9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they
shall perceive that it is his work.

10 The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in
him: and all they that are true of heart shall be glad.

DAY 12 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 65. _Te decet hymnus_.

Thou, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be
performed in Jerusalem.

2 Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.

3 My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.

4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee:
he shall dwell in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the
pleasures of thy house, even of thy holy temple.

5 Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God
of our salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the
earth, and of them that remain in the broad sea.

6 Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded
about with power.

7 Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves,
and the madness of the people.

8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall
be afraid at thy tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the
morning and evening to praise thee.

9 Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very
plenteous.

10 The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn,
for so thou providest for the earth.

11 Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little
valleys thereof: thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and
blessest the increase of it.

12 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop
fatness.

13 They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the
little hills shall rejoice on every side.

14 The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand
so thick with corn, that they shall laugh and sing.

PSALM 66. _Jubilate Deo_.

O be joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of
his Name, make his praise to be glorious.

2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.

3 For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise
thy Name.

4 O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is
in his doing toward the children of men.

5 He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the
water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.

6 He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people:
and such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.

7 O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise
to be heard;

8 Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to
slip.

9 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like
as silver is tried.

10 Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our
loins.

11 Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through
fire and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay
thee my vows, which I promised with my lips, and spake with my
mouth, when I was in trouble.

13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense
of rams: I will offer bullocks and goats.

14 O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will
tell you what he hath done for my soul.

151 called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my
tongue.

16 If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not
hear me.

17 But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.

18 Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned
his mercy from me.

PSALM 67. _Deus misereatur_.

God be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of
his countenance, and be merciful unto us:

2 That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among
all nations.

3 Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise
thee.

4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the
folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.

5 Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.

6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our
own God, shall give us his blessing.

7 God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

DAY 13 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 68. _Exsurgat Deus_.

Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also
that hate him flee before him.

2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and
like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the
presence of God.

3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them
also be merry and joyful.

4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him
that rideth upon the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise
him in his Name JAH, and rejoice before him.

5 He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the
widows: even God in his holy habitation.

6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and
bringeth the prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates
continue in scarceness.

7 O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou
wentest through the wilderness;

8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God:
even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God
of Israel.

9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and
refreshedst it when it was weary.

10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of
thy goodness prepared for the poor.

11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.

12 Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and
they of the household divided the spoil.

13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings
of a dove: that is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like
gold.

14 When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they
as white as snow in Salmon.

15 As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as
the hill of Basan.

16 Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which
it pleaseth him to dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.

17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
angels: and the Lord is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.

18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and
received gifts for men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord
God might dwell among them.

19 Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and
poureth his benefits upon us.

20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is
the Lord, by whom we escape death.

21 God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of
such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness.

22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from
Basan: mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep
of the sea.

23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and
that the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same.

24 It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and
King, goest in the sanctuary.

25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst
are the damsels playing with the timbrels.

26 Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations:
from the ground of the heart.

27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah
their counsel: the princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.

28 Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing,
O God, that thou hast wrought in us,

29 For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents
unto thee.

30 When the company of the spear-men and multitude of the mighty
are scattered abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they
humbly bring pieces of silver: and when he hath scattered the
people that delight in war;

31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt: the Morians land shall
soon stretch out her hands unto God.

32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto
the Lord;

33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he
doth send out his voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.

34 Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and
strength is in the clouds.

35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of
Israel, he will give strength and power unto his people; blessed
be God.

DAY 13 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 69. _Salvum me fac_.

Save me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.

2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come
into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.

3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for
waiting so long upon my God.

4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my
head: they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless,
are mighty.

5 I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my
simpleness, and my faults are not hid from thee.

6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed
for my cause: let not those that seek thee be confounded through
me, O Lord God of Israel.

7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered
my face.

8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my
mother's children.

9 For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes
of them that rebuked thee are fallen upon me.

10 I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned
to my reproof.

11 I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.

12 They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards
make songs upon me.

13 But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.

14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the
truth of thy salvation.

15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered
from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

16 Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow
me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

17 Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn
thee unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies.

18 And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble:
O haste thee, and hear me.

19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of
mine enemies.

20 Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine
adversaries are all in thy sight.

21 Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I
looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither
found I any to comfort me.

22 They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me
vinegar to drink.

23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and
let the things that should have been for their wealth be unto them
an occasion of falling.

24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou
down their backs.

25 Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful
displeasure take hold of them.

26 Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.

27 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk
how they may vex them whom thou hast wounded.

28 Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and riot come
into thy righteousness.

29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be
written among the righteous.

30 As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God,
shall lift me up.

31 I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with
thanksgiving.

32 This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that
hath horns and hoofs.

33 The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God,
and your soul shall live.

34 For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.

35 Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth
therein.

36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men
may dwell there, and have it in possession.

37 The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they
that love his Name shall dwell therein.

PSALM 70. _Deus, in adjutorium_.

Haste thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.

2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let
them be turned back ward and put to confusion that wish me evil.

3 Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over
me, There, there.

4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and
let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be
praised.

5 As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.

6 Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

DAY 14 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 71. _In te, Domine, speravi_.

In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to
confusion: but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline
thine ear unto me, and save me.

2 Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast
promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.

3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

4 For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my
hope, even from my youth.

5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou
art he that took me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be
always of thee.

6 I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is
in thee.

7 O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy
glory and honour all the day long.

8 Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my
strength faileth me.

9 For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my
soul take their counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him;
persecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliver him.

10 Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.

11 Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let
them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.

12 As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee
more and more.

13 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation:
for I know no end thereof.

14 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make
mention of thy righteousness only.

15 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore
will I tell of thy wondrous works.

16 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed:
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
power to all them that are yet for to come.

17 Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are
they that thou hast done; O God, who is like unto thee?

18 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and
yet didst thou turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the
deep of the earth again.

19 Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every
side.

20 Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God,
playing upon an instrument of music: unto thee will I sing upon
the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

21 My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul
whom thou hast delivered.

22 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me
evil.

PSALM 72. _Deus, judicium_.

Give the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto
the King's son.

2 Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend
the poor.

3 The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills
righteousness unto the people.

4 He shall keep the simple folk by their right; defend the children
of the poor, and punish the wrong-doer.

5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from
one generation to another.

6 He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as
the drops that water the earth.

7 In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of
peace, so long as the moon endureth.

8 His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and
from the flood unto the world's end.

9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his
enemies shall lick the dust.

10 The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the
kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts.

11 All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him
service.

12 For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also,
and him that hath no helper.

13 He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall
preserve the souls of the poor.

14 He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear
shall their blood be in his sight.

15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of
Arabia: prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he
be praised.

16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the
hills: his fruit shall shake like Libanus, and shall be green in
the city like grass upon the earth.

17 His Name shall endure for ever, his Name shall remain under
the sun among the posterities: which shall be blessed through him,
and all the heathen shall praise him.

18 Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only
doeth wondrous things;

19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the
earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

DAY 14 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 73. _Quam bonus Israel!_

Truly God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean
heart.

2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had
well-nigh slipt.

3 And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly
in such prosperity.

4 For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.

5 They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they
plagued like other men.

6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and
overwhelmed with cruelty.

7 Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.

8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking
is against the most High.

9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their
tongue goeth through the world.

10 Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no
small advantage.

11 Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge
in the most High?

12 Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and
these have riches in possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed
my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.

13 All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every
morning.

14 Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should
have condemned the gene ration of thy children.

15 Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,

16 Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the
end of these men;

17 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest
them down, and destroyest them.

18 O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful
end!

19 Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make
their image to vanish out of the city.

20 Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.

21 So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before
thee.

22 Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by
my right hand.

23 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive
me with glory.

24 Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth
that I desire in comparison of thee.

25 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever.

26 For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed
all them that commit fornication against thee.

27 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust
in the Lord God: and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the
daughter of Sion.

PSALM 74. _Ut quid, Deus?_

O God, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath
so hot against the sheep of thy pasture?

2 O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and
redeemed of old.

3 Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and Mount Sion, wherein
thou hast dwelt.

4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy:
which hath done evil in thy sanctuary.

5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and
set up their banners for tokens.

6 He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to
bring it to an excellent work.

7 But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes
and hammers.

8 They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the
dwelling-place of thy Name, even unto the ground.

9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havock of them
altogether: thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the
land.

10 We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not
one is there among us, that understandeth any more.

11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long
shall the enemy blaspheme thy Name, for ever?

12 Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right
hand out of thy bosom to consume the enemy?

13 For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he
doeth it himself.

14 Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters.

15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces: and gavest him
to be meat for the people in the wilderness.

16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks:
thou driedst up mighty waters.

17 The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared
the light and the sun.

18 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer
and winter.

19 Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the
foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.

20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of
the enemies: and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever,

21 Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness
and cruel habitations.

22 O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy
give praise unto thy Name.

23 Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish
man blasphemeth thee daily.

24 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them
that hate thee increaseth ever more and more.

DAY 15 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 75. _Confitebimur tibi_.

Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give
thanks.

2 Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.

3 When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto
right.

4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the
pillars of it.

5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set
not up your horn.

6 Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.

7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west:
nor yet from the south.

8 And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
another.

9 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red:
it is full mixed, and he poureth out of the same.

10 As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall
drink them, and suck them out

11 But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.

12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted.

PSALM 76. _Notus in Judaea_.

In Jewry is God known: his Name is great in Israel.

2 At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.

3 There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and
the battle.

4 Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.

5 The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the
men whose hands were mighty have found nothing.

6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are
fallen.

7 Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
when thou art angry?

8 Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth
trembled, and was still;

9 When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.

10 The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness
of them shalt thou refrain.

11 Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are
round about him: bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

12 He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among
the kings of the earth.

PSALM 77. _Voce mea ad Dominum_.

I will cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my
voice, and he shall hearken unto me.

2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and
ceased not in the night-season; my soul refused comfort.

3 When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is
vexed, I will complain.

4 Thou boldest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot
speak.

5 I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.

6 I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with
mine own heart, and search out my spirit.

7 Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more
intreated?

8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly
to an end for evermore?

9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his
loving-kindness in displeasure?

10 And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the
years of the right hand of the most Highest.

11 I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy
wonders of old time.

12 I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of
thy doings.

13 Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?

14 Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power
among the people.

15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob
and Joseph.

16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were
afraid: the depths also were troubled.

17 The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows
went abroad.

18 The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings
shone upon the ground; the earth was moved, and shook withal.

19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and
thy footsteps are not known.

20 Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and
Aaron.

DAY 15 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 78. _Attendite, popule_.

Hear my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my
mouth.

2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences
of old;

3 Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told
us;

4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations
to come: but to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful
works that he hath done.

5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he
commanded our forefathers to teach their children;

6 That their posterity might know it: and the children which were
yet unborn;

7 To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their
children the same;

8 That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the
works of God, but to keep his commandments;

9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn
generation: a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit cleaveth not stedfastly unto God;

10 Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and
carrying bows, turned themselves back in the day of battle.

11 They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his
law;

12 But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had
shewed for them.

13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in
the land of Egypt: even in the field of Zoan.

14 He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters
to stand on an heap.

15 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the
night through with a light of fire.

16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink
thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.

17 He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out
like the rivers.

18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the
most Highest in the wilderness.

19 They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their
lust.

20 They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table
in the wilderness?

21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and
the streams flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide
flesh for his people?

22 When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled
in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;

23 Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in
his help.

24 So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.

25 He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them
food from heaven.

26 So man did eat angels food: for he sent them meat enough.

27 He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his
power he brought in the south-west-wind.

28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls
like as the sand of the sea.

29 He let it fall among their tents: even round about their
habitation.

30 So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own
desire: they were not disappointed of their lust.

31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of
God came upon them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote
down the chosen men that were in Israel.

32 But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his
wondrous works.

33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years
in trouble.

34 When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and
inquired after God.

35 And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the
high God was their redeemer.

36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and
dissembled with him in their tongue.

37 For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they
stedfast in his covenant.

38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and
destroyed them not.

39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer
his whole displeasure to arise.

40 For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were
even a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved
him in the desert.

42 They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in
Israel.

43 They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered
them from the hand of the enemy;

44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in
the field of Zoan.

45 He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink
of the rivers.

46 He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to
destroy them.

47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto
the grasshopper.

48 He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees
with the frost.

49 He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks
with hot thunderbolts.

50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure,
and trouble: and sent evil angels among them.

51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul
from death: but gave their life over to the pestilence;

52 And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and
mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.

53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and
carried them in the wilderness like a flock.

54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and
overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.

55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to
his mountain which he purchased with his right hand.

56 He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land
to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of
Israel to dwell in their tents.

57 So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not
his testimonies;

58 But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers:
starting aside like a broken bow.

59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him
to displeasure with their images.

60 When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure
at Israel.

61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that
he had pitched among men.

62 He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into
the enemy's hand.

63 He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with
his inheritance.

64 The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not
given to marriage.

65 Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no
widows to make lamentation.

66 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant
refreshed with wine.

67 He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a
perpetual shame.

68 He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe
of Ephraim;

69 But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he
loved.

70 And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation
of it like the ground which he hath made continually.

71 He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the
sheep-folds.

72 As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him:
that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them
prudently with all his power.

DAY 16 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 79. _Deus, venerunt_.

O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy
temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.

2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
the fowls of the air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts
of the land.

3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem:
and there was no man to bury them.

4 We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and
derision unto them that are round about us.

5 Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like
fire for ever?

6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known
thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.

7 For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling-place.

8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that
soon: for we are come to great misery.

9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O
deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.

10 Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?

11 O let the vengeance of thy servants blood that is shed: be
openly shewed upon the heathen in our sight.

12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee:
according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that
are appointed to die.

13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed
thee: reward thou them, O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.

14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall
give thee thanks for ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy
praise from generation to generation.

PSALM 80. _Qui regis Israel_.

Hear, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
sheep: shew thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.

2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength,
and come and help us.

3 Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.

4 O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people
that prayeth?

5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them
plenteousness of tears to drink.

6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our
enemies laugh us to scorn.

7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.

8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it.

9 Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled
the land.

10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedar-trees.

11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs
unto the river.

12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go
by pluck off her grapes?

13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild
beasts of the field devour it.

14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven:
behold, and visit this vine;

15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted:
and the branch that thou madest so strong for thyself.

16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at
the rebuke of thy countenance.

17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the
son of man, whom thou madest so strong for thine own self.

18 And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we
shall call upon thy Name.

19 Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy
countenance, and we shall be whole.

PSALM 81. _Exultate Deo_.

Sing we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise
unto the God of Jacob.

2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with
the lute.

3 Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed,
and upon our solemn feast-day.

4 For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of
Jacob.

5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out
of the land of Egypt, and had heard a strange language.

6 I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were
delivered from making the pots.

7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and
heard thee what time as the storm fell upon thee.

8 I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.

9 Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou
wilt hearken unto me,

10 There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou
worship any other god.

11 I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.

12 But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not
obey me.

13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts* lusts: and let them
follow their own imaginations.

14 O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel
had walked in my ways,

15 I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand
against their adversaries.

16 The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their
time should have endured for ever.

17 He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and
with honey out of the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

DAY 16 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 82. _Deus stetit_.

God standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among
gods.

2 How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons
of the ungodly?

3 Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need
and necessity have right.

4 Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the
ungodly.

5 They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in
darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

6 I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the
most Highest.

7 But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.

8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take
all heathen to thine inheritance.

PSALM 83. _Deus, quis similis?_

Hold not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not
thyself, O God.

2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate
thee have lift up their head.

3 They have imagined craftily against thy people's and taken
counsel against thy secret ones.

4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be
no more a people: and that the name of Israel may be no more in
remembrance.

5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and
are confederate against thee;

6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites
and Hagarenes;

7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that
dwell at Tyre.

8 Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of
Lot.

9 But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and
unto Jabin at the brook of Kison;

10 Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.

11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all
their princes like as Zeba and Salmana;

12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in
possession.

13 O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble
before the wind;

14 Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame
that consumeth the mountains.

15 Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid
with thy storm.

16 Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.

17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them
be put to shame, and perish.

18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only
the most Highest over all the earth.

PSALM 84. _Quam dilecta!_

O how amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!

2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of
the Lord: my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.

3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a
nest where she may lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of
hosts, my Bang and my God.

4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway
praising thee.

5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart
are thy ways.

6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and
the pools are filled with water.

7 They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of
gods appeareth every one of them in Sion.

8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: hearken, O God of Jacob.

9 Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine
Anointed.

10 For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.

11 I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than
to dwell in the tents of ungodliness.

12 For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give
grace and worship, and no good thing shall he withhold from them
that live a godly life.

13 O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his
trust in thee.

PSALM 85. _Benedixisti, Domine_.

Lord, thou art become gracious unto thy  land: thou hast turned
away the captivity of Jacob.

2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all
their sins.

3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself
from thy wrathful indignation.

4 Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.

5 Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out
thy wrath from one generation to another?

6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may
rejoice in thee?

7 Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.

8 I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for
he shall speak peace unto his people, and to his saints, that
they turn not again.

9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may
dwell in our land.

10 Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness  and peace
have kissed each other.

11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath
looked down from heaven.

12 Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall
give her increase.

13 Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his
going in the way.

DAY 17 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 86. _Inclina, Domine_.

Bow down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in
misery.

2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant
that putteth his trust in thee.

3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.

4 Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
lift up my soul.

5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto
all them that call upon thee.

6 Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble
desires.

7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou
hearest me.

8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is
not one that can do as thou doest.

9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee,
O Lord: and shall glorify thy Name.

10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
alone.

11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit
my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.

12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will
praise thy Name for evermore.

13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
soul from the nethermost hell.

14 O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations
of naughty men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee
before their eyes.

15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy:
long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and truth.

16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy
strength unto thy servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.

17 Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may
see it and be ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and
comforted me.

PSALM 87. _Fundamenta ejus_.

Her foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the
gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.

3 I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.

4 Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the
Morians; lo, there was he born.

5 And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and
the most High shall stablish her.

6 The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people:
that he was born there.

7 The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh
springs shall be in thee.

PSALM 88. _Domine Deus_.

O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
thee: O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear
unto my calling.

2 For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto
hell.

3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I
have been even as a man that hath no strength.

4 Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie
in the grave: who are out of remembrance, and are cut away from
thy hand.

5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness,
and in the deep.

6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me
with all thy storms.

7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me
to be abhorred of them.

8 I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.

9 My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily
upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee.

10 Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise
up again, and praise thee?

11 Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy
faithfulness in destruction?

12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy
righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?

13 Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come
before thee.

14 Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face
from me?

15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die:
even from my youth up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled
mind.

16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee
hath undone me.

17 They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me
together on every side.

18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid
mine acquaintance out of my sight.

DAY 17 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 89. _Misericordias Domini_.

My song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with
my mouth will I ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to
another.

2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth
shalt thou stablish in the heavens.

3 I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David
my servant;

4 Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from
one generation to another.

5 O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and
thy truth in the congregation of the saints.

6 For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto
the Lord?

7 And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?

8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints:
and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.

9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most
mighty Lord, is on every side.

10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves
thereof when they arise.

11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered
thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arm.

12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast
laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is.

13 Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall
rejoice in thy Name.

14 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
right hand.

15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy
and truth shall go before thy face.

16 Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they
shall walk in the light of thy countenance.

17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness
shall they make their boast.

18 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy
loving-kindness thou shalt lift up our horns.

19 For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.

20 Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I
have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen
out of the people.

21 I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed
him.

22 My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.

23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of
wickedness shall not hurt him.

24 I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them
that hate him.

25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name
shall his horn be exalted.

26 I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand
in the floods.

27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong
salvation.

28 And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of
the earth.

29 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant
shall stand fast with him.

30 His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne
as the days of heaven.

31 But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;

32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I
will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.

33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from
him: nor suffer my truth to fail.

34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips: I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not
fail David.

35 His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the
sun before me.

36 He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the
faithful witness in heaven.

37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art
displeased at him.

38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his
crown to the ground.

39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong
holds.

40 All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to
his neighbours.

41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all
his adversaries to rejoice.

42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not
victory in the battle.

43 Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the
ground.

44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him
with dishonour.

45 Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall
thy wrath burn like fire?

46 O remember how short my time is: where fore hast thou made
all men for nought?

47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall
he deliver his soul from the hand of hell?

48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest
unto David in thy truth?

49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I
do bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;

50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered
the footsteps of thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore.
Amen, and Amen.

DAY 18 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 90. _Domine, refugium_.

Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.

2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and
the world were made: thou art God from everlasting, and world
without end.

3 Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again,
ye children of men.

4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing
that is past as a watch in the night.

5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and
fade away suddenly like the grass.

6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening
it is cut down, dried up, and withered.

7 For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy
wrathful indignation.

8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins
in the light of thy countenance.

9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our
years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.

10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though
men be so strong that they come to fourscore years: yet is their
strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and
we are gone.

11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter
as a man feareth, so is thy displeasure.

12 So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom.

13 Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy
servants.

14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice
and be glad all the days of our life.

15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us:
and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.

16 Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.

17 And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us:
prosper thou the work of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our
handy-work.

PSALM 91. _Qui habitat_.

Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty.

2 I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold:
my God, in him will I trust.

3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and
from the noisome pestilence.

4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe
under his feathers: his faith fulness and truth shall be thy shield
and buckler.

5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the
arrow that flieth by day;

6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness
that destroyeth in the noonday.

7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy
right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.

8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward
of the ungodly.

9 For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of
defence very high.

10 There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee
in all thy ways.

12 They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy
foot against a stone.

13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.

14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
him: I will set him up, because he hath known my Name.

15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with
him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring him to honour.

16 With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

PSALM 92. _Bonum est confiteri_.

It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing
praises unto thy Name, O most Highest;

2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of
thy truth in the night-season;

3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a
loud instrument, and upon the harp.

4 For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I
will rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands.

5 O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.

6 An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not
understand it.

7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers
of wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever;
but thou, Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.

8 For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish:
and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.

9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for
I am anointed with fresh oil.

10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear
shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise up against me.

11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread
abroad like a cedar in Libanus.

12 Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish
in the courts of the house of our God.

13 They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall
be fat and well-liking.

14 That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that
there is no unrighteousness in him.

DAY 18 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 93. _Dominus regnavit_.

The Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath
put on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.

2 He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.

3 Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou
art from everlasting.

4 The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their
voice: the floods lift up their waves.

5 The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet
the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.

6 Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine
house for ever.

PSALM 94. _Dem ultionum_.

O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.

2 Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their
deserving.

3 Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly
triumph?

4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make
such proud boasting?

5 They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.

6 They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless
to death.

7 And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall
the God of Jacob regard it.

8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye
understand?

9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the
eye, shall he not see?

10 Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man
knowledge, shall not he punish?

11 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.

12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest
him in thy law;

13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until
the pit be digged up for the ungodly.

14 For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake
his inheritance;

15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgement:  all such as are
true in heart shall follow it.

16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take
my part against the evil-doers?

17 If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul
had been put to silence.

18 But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me
up.

19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy
comforts have refreshed my soul.

20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness:
which imagineth mischief as a law?

21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous:
and condemn the innocent blood.

22 But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my
confidence.

23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in
their own malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

DAY 19 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 95. _Venite, exultemus_.

O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation.

2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew
ourselves glad in him with psalms.

3 For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.

4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength
of the hills is his also.

5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry
land.

6 O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord
our Maker.

7 For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture,
and the sheep of his hand.

8 To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in
the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;

9 When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.

10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said:
It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known
my ways;

11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into
my rest.

PSALM 96. _Cantate Domino_.

O sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole
earth.

2 Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his
salvation from day to day.

3 Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all
people.

4 For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is
more to be feared than all gods.

5 As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it
is the Lord that made the heavens.

6 Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his
sanctuary.

7 Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe
unto the Lord worship and power.

8 Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring
presents, and come into his courts.

9 O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole
earth stand in awe of him.

10 Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that
it is he who hath made the round world so fast that it cannot be
moved; and how that he shall judge the people righteously.

11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea
make a noise, and all that therein is.

12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all
the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord.

13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with
righteousness to judge the world, and the people with his truth.

PSALM 97. _Dominus regnavit_.

The Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude
of the isles may be glad thereof.

2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
judgement are the habitation of his seat.

3 There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on
every side.

4 His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and
was afraid.

5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

6 The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people
have seen his glory.

7 Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that
delight in vain gods: worship him, all ye gods.

8 Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were
glad, because of thy judgements, O Lord.

9 For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou
art exalted far above all gods.

10 O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is
evil: the Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall
deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.

11 There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and joyful
gladness for such as are true-hearted.

12 Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a
remembrance of his holiness.

DAY 19 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 98. _Cantate Domino_.

O sing unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous
things.

2 With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten
himself the victory.

3 The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he
openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

4 He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of
Israel: and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation
of our God.

5 Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing,
rejoice, and give thanks.

6 Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm
of thanksgiving.

7 With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before
the Lord the King.

8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round
world, and they that dwell therein.

9 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful
together before the Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.

10 With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people
with equity.

PSALM 99. _Dominus regnavit_.

The Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth
between the cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.

2 The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.

3 They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful,
and holy.

4 The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity:
thou hast executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.

5 O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool,
for he is holy.

6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call
upon his Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.

7 He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his
testimonies, and the law that he gave them.

8 Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God,
and punishedst their own inventions.

9 O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill:
for the Lord our God is holy.

PSALM 100. _Jubilate Deo_.

O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with
gladness, and come before his presence with a song.

2 Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us,
and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
pasture.

3 O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his
courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and speak good of his
Name.

4 For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is ever lasting: and his
truth endureth from generation to generation.

PSALM 101. _Misericordiam et judicium_.

My song shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will
I sing.

2 O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.

3 When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a
perfect heart.

4 I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of
unfaithfulness: there shall no such cleave unto me.

5 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
person.


6 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.

7 Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not
suffer him.

8 Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they
may dwell with me.

9 Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.

10 There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that
telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

11 I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land:
that I may root out all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

DAY 20 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 102. _Domine, exaudi_.

Hear my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.

2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline
thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.

3 For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt
up as it were a fire-brand.

4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass: so that I
forget to eat my bread.

5 For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to
my flesh.

6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl
that is in the desert.

7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth
alone upon the house-top.

8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad
upon me are sworn together against me.

9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink
with weeping;

10 And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast
taken me up, and cast me down.

11 My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.

12 But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance
throughout all generations.

13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time
that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come.

14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth
them to see her in the dust.

15 The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of
the earth thy majesty;

16 When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall
appear;

17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and
despiseth not their desire.


18 This shall be written for those that come after: and the people
which shall be born shall praise the Lord.

19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven
did the Lord behold the earth;

20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity:
and deliver the children appointed unto death;

21 That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his
worship at Jerusalem;

22 When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also,
to serve the Lord.

23 He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.

24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine
age: as for thy years, they endure throughout all generations.

25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.

26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax
old as doth a garment;

27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

28 The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed
shall stand fast in thy sight

PSALM 103. _Benedic, anima mea_.

Praise the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his
holy Name.

2 Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;

3 Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;

4 Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with
mercy and loving-kindness;

5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young
and lusty as an eagle.

6 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them
that are oppressed with wrong.

7 He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of
Israel.

8 The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and
of great goodness.

9 He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for
ever.

10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us
according to our wickednesses.

11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth:
so great is his mercy also toward them that fear him.

12 Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he
set our sins from us.

13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is
the Lord merciful unto them that fear him.

14 For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we
are but dust

15 The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a
flower of the field.

16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the
place thereof shall know it no more.

17 But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and
ever upon them that fear him: and his righteousness upon children's
children;

18 Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his
commandments to do them.

19 The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom
ruleth over all.

20 O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength:
ye that fulfil his commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his
words.

21 O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do
his pleasure.

22 O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places
of his dominion: praise thou the Lord, O my soul.

DAY 20 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 104. _Benedic, anima mea_.

Praise the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become
exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.

2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment:
and spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.

3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh
the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.

4 He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.

5 He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should
move at any time.

6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the
waters stand in the hills.

7 At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are
afraid.

8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath:
even unto the place which thou hast appointed for them.

9 Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass:
neither turn again to cover the earth.

10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.

11 All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses
quench their thirst.

12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation:
and sing among the branches.

13 He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the
fruit of thy works.

14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the
service of men;

15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh
glad the heart of man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance,
and bread to strengthen man's heart.

16 The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of
Libanus which he hath planted;

17 Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a
dwelling for the stork.

18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the
stony rocks for the conies.

19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth
his going down.

20 Thou makest darkness that it maybe night: wherein all the
beasts of the forest do move.

21 The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.

22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them
down in their dens.

23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the
evening.

24 O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made
them all; the earth is full of thy riches.

25 So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts.

26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan: whom thou
hast made to take his pastime therein.

27 These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in
due season.

28 When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest
thy hand they are filled with good.

29 When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest
away their breath they die, and are turned again to their dust.

30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and
thou shalt renew the face of the earth.

31 The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the
Lord shall rejoice in his works.

32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch
the hills, they shall smoke.

33 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my
God while I have my being.

34 And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.

35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and
the ungodly shall come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul,
praise the Lord.

DAY 21 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 105. _Confitemini Domino_.

O give thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the
people what things he hath done.

2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking
be of all his wondrous works.

3 Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the Lord.

4 Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.

5 Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders,
and the judgements of his mouth,

6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.

7 He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.

8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that
he made to a thousand generations;

9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that
he sware unto Isaac;

10 And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for
an everlasting testament;

11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of
your inheritance;

12 When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in
the land;

13 What time as they went from one nation to another: from one
kingdom to another people;

14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings
for their sakes;

15 Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.

16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed
all the provision of bread.

17 But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold
to be a bond-servant;

18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his
soul;

19 Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the
Lord tried him.

20 The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let
him go free.

21 He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his
substance;

22 That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach
his senators wisdom.

23 Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the
land of Ham.

24 And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger
than their enemies;

25 Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt
untruly with his servants.

26 Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.

27 And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the
land of Ham.

28 He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient
unto his word.

29 He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.

30 Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings
chambers.

31 He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and
lice in all their quarters.

32 He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their
land.

33 He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the
trees that were in their coasts.

34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars
innumerable: and did eat up all the grass in their land, and
devoured the fruit of their ground.

35 He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of
all their strength.

36 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was
not one feeble person among their tribes.

37 Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.

38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give
light in the night-season.

39 At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the
bread of heaven.

40 He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that
rivers ran in the dry places.

41 For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.

42 And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with
gladness;

43 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the
labours of the people in possession;

44 That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

DAY 21 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 106. _Confitemini Domino_.

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy
endureth for ever.

2 Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all
his praise?

3 Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.

4 Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest
unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

5 That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the
gladness of thy people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.

6 We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt
wickedly.

7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept
they thy great goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at
the sea, even at the Red sea.

8 Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might
make his power to be known.

9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
through the deep, as through a wilderness.

10 And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered
them from the hand of the enemy.

11 As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them:
there was not one of them left.

12 Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.

13 But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide
his counsel.

14 But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God
in the desert.

15 And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into
their soul.

16 They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of
the Lord.

17 So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the
congregation of Abiram.

18 And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up
the ungodly.

19 They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.

20 Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf
that eateth hay.

21 And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things
in Egypt;

22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the
Red sea.

23 So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful
indignation, lest he should destroy them.

24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no
credence unto his word;

25 But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice
of the Lord.

26 Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the
wilderness;

27 To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them
in the lands.

28 They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings
of the dead.

29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and
the plague was great among them.

30 Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.

31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all
posterities for evermore.

32 They angered mm also at the waters of strife: so that he
punished Moses for their sakes;

33 Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips.

34 Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;

35 But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.

36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to
their own decay: yea, they offered their sons and their daughters
unto devils;

37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters: whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan; and
the land was defiled with blood.

38 Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring
with their own inventions.

39 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people:
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

40 And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they
that hated them were lords over them.

41 Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.

42 Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him
with then* own inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.

43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their
complaint.

44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the
multitude of his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them
away captive to pity them.

45 Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the
heathen: that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make
our boast of thy praise.

46 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world
without end: And let all the people say, Amen.

DAY 22 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 107. _Confitemini Domino_.

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy
endureth for ever.

2 Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered
from the hand of the enemy;

3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the
west: from the north and from the south.

4 They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no
city to dwell in;

5 Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.

6 So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered
them from their distress.

7 He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the
city where they dwelt.

8 O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

9 For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness.

10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast
bound in misery and iron;

11 Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly
regarded the counsel of the most Highest;

12 He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell
down, and there was none to help them.

13 So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered
them out of their distress.

14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of
death: and brake their bonds in sunder.

15 O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness:
and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men.

16 For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of
iron in sunder.

17 Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their
wickedness.

18 Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard
at death's door.

19 So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered
them out of their distress.

20 He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from
their destruction.

21 O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness:
and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving:
and tell out his works with gladness!

23 They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their
business in great waters;

24 These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.

25 For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the
waves thereof.

26 They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep:
their soul melteth away because of the trouble.

27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are
at their wit's end.

28 So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth
them out of their distress.

29 For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are
still.

30 Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth
them unto the haven where they would be.

31 O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness:
and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the
people: and praise him in the seat of the elders!

33 Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the
water-springs.

34 A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein.

35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs
of a dry ground

36 And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city
to dwell in;

37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield
them fruits of increase.

38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth
not their cattle to decrease.

39 And again, when they are minished and brought low: through
oppression, through any plague or trouble;

40 Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and
let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;

41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households
like a flock of sheep.

42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of
all wickedness shall be stopped.

43 Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand
the loving-kindness of the Lord.

DAY 22 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 108. _Paratum cor meum_.

O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give
praise with the best member that I have.

2 Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.

3 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will
sing praises unto thee among the nations.

4 For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds.

5 Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
all the earth.

6 That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them,
and hear thou me.

7 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and
divide Sichem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

8 Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength
of my head.

9 Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast
out my shoe, upon Philistia will I triumph.

10 Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me
into Edom?

11 Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go
forth with our hosts?

12 O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.

13 Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall
tread down our enemies.

PSALM 109. _Deus, laudem_.

Hold not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the
ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.

2 And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed
me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a
cause.

3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary
part: but I give myself unto prayer.

4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good
will.

5 Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand
at his right hand.

6 When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let
his prayer be turned into sin.

7 Let his days be few: and let another take his office.

8 Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.

9 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek
it also out of desolate places.

10 Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the
stranger spoil his labour.

11 Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon
his fatherless children.

12 Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let
his name be clean put out.

13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the
sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be done away.

14 Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the
memorial of them from off the earth.

15 And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted
the poor helpless man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.

16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he
loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from him,

17 He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it
shall come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

18 Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as
the girdle that he is alway girded withal.

19 Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those
that speak evil against my soul.

20 But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name:
for sweet is thy mercy.

21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is
wounded within me.

22 I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away
as the grasshopper.

23 My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for
want of fatness.

24 I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me
shaked their heads.

25 Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.

26 And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou,
Lord, hast done it.

27 Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded
that rise up against me; but let thy servant rejoice.

28 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a cloke.

29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth:
and praise him among the multitude.

30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his
soul from unrighteous judges.

DAY 23 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 110. _Dixit Dominus_.

The Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool.

2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou
ruler, even in the midst among thine enemies.

3 In the day of thy power shall thy people offer thee free-will
offerings with an holy worship: the dew of thy birth is of the
womb of the morning.

4 The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever
after the order of Melchisedech.

5 The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day
of his wrath.

6 He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places
with the dead bodies: and smite in sunder the heads over divers
countries.

7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift
up his head.

PSALM 111. _Confitebor tibi_.

I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly
among the faithful, and in the congregation.

2 The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all them that have
pleasure therein.

3 His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his
righteousness endureth for ever.

4 The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works:
that they ought to be had in remembrance.

5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be
mindful of his covenant.

6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may
give them the heritage of the heathen.

7 The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his
commandments are true.

8 They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and
equity.

9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant
for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.

10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good
understanding have all they that do thereafter; the praise of it
endureth for ever.

PSALM 112. _Beatus vir_.

Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight
in his commandments.

2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
faithful shall be blessed.

3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his
righteousness endureth for ever.

4 Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is
merciful, loving, and righteous.

5 A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words
with discretion.

6 For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in
everlasting remembrance.

7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth
fast, and believeth in the Lord.

8 His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his
desire upon his enemies.

9 He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his
righteousness remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with
honour.

10 The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall
gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly
shall perish.

PSALM 113. _Laudate, pueri_.

Praise the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.

2 Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.

3 The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto
the going down of the same.

4 The Lord is high above all heathen: and his glory above the
heavens.

5 Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so
high: and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in
heaven and earth?

6 He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor
out of the mire;

7 That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of
his people.

8 He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful
mother of children.

DAY 23 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 114. _In exitu Israel_.

When Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among
the strange people,

2 Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.

3 The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

4 The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young
sheep.

5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou
Jordan, that thou wast driven back?

6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills,
like young sheep?

7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence
of the God of Jacob;

8 Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone
into a springing well.

PSALM 115. _Non nobis, Domine_.

Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the
praise: for thy loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.

2 Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?

3 As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased
him.

4 Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.

5 They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.

6 They have ears, and hear not: noses have they, and smell not.

7 They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not:
neither speak they through their throat.

8 They that make them are like unto them: and so are all such as
put their trust in them.

9 But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their
succour and defence.

10 Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper
and defender.

11 Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their
helper and defender.

12 The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he
shall bless the house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.

13 He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.

14 The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.

15 Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.

16 All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given
to the children of men.

17 The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down
into silence.

18 But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
Praise the Lord.

DAY 24 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 116. _Dilexi, quoniam_.

I am well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer;

2 That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon
him as long as I live.

3 The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of
hell gat hold upon me.

4 I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name
of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

5 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful.

6 The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.

7 Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath
rewarded thee.

8 And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling.

9 I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

10 I believed, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled:
I said in my haste, All men are liars.

11 What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits
that he hath done unto me?

12 I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of
the Lord.

13 I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right
dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.

14 Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant,
and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.

15 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and will call
upon the Name of the Lord.

16 I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people:
in the courts of the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.

PSALM 117. _Laudate Dominum_.

O praise the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.

2 For his merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us: and
the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.

PSALM 118. _Confitemini Domino_.

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy
endureth for ever.

2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy
endureth for ever.

3 Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for
ever.

4 Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy
endureth for ever.

5 I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.

6 The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.

7 The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall
I see my desire upon mine enemies.

8 It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in
man.

9 It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence
in princes.

10 All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the
Lord will I destroy them.

11 They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every
side: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy them.

12 They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire
among the thorns: for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.

13 Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord
was my help.

14 The Lord is my strength, and my song i and is become my salvation.

15 The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous:
the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass,

16 The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand
of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.

17 I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.

18 The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given
me over unto death.

19 Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and
give thanks unto the Lord.

20 This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.

21 I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my
salvation.

22 The same stone which the builders refused: is become the
head-stone in the corner.

23 This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.

24 This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and
be glad in it.

25 Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.

26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished
you good luck, ye that are of the house of the Lord.

27 God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with
cords, yea, even unto the horns of the altar.

28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I
will praise thee.

29 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy
endureth for ever.

DAY 24 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 119. _Beati immaculati_.

Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the
law of the Lord.

2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies: and seek him with
their whole heart.

3 For they who do no wickedness: walk in his ways.

4 Thou hast charged: that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.

5 O that my ways were made so direct: that I might keep thy statutes!

6 So shall I not be confounded: while I have respect unto all thy
commandments.

7 I will thank thee with an unfeigned heart: when I shall have
learned the judgements of thy righteousness.

8 I will keep thy ceremonies: O forsake me not utterly.

_In quo corrigit?_

Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way: even by ruling
himself after thy word.

10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: let me not go wrong
out of thy commandments.

11 Thy words have I hid within my heart: that I should not sin
against thee.

12 Blessed art thou, O Lord: O teach me thy statutes.

13 With my lips have I been telling: of all the judgements of thy
mouth.

14 I have had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies: as
in all manner of riches.

15 I will talk of thy commandments: and have respect unto thy ways.

16 My delight shall be in thy statutes: and I will not forget thy
word.

_Retribue servo tuo_.

O do well unto thy servant: that I may live, and keep thy word.

18 Open thou mine eyes: that I may see the wondrous things of thy
law.

19 I am a stranger upon earth: O hide not thy commandments from me.

20 My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire: that it hath
alway unto thy judgements.

21 Thou hast rebuked the proud: and cursed are they that do err
from thy commandments.

22 O turn from me shame and rebuke: for I have kept thy testimonies.

23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant is
occupied in thy statutes.

24 For thy testimonies are my delight: and my counsellors.

_Adhaesit pavimento_.

My soul cleaveth to the dust: O quicken thou me, according to thy
word.

26 I have acknowledged my ways, and thou heardest me: O teach me
thy statutes.

27 Make me to understand the way of thy commandments: and so shall
I talk of thy wondrous works.

28 My soul melteth away for very heaviness: comfort thou me
according unto thy word.

29 Take from me the way of lying: and cause thou me to make much of
thy law.

30 I have chosen the way of truth: and thy judgements have I laid
before me.

31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O Lord, confound me not.

32 I will run the way of thy commandments: when thou hast set my
heart at liberty.

DAY 25 MORNING PRAYER

_Legem pone_.

Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes: and I shall keep it unto
the end.

34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law: yea, I shall
keep it with my whole heart.

35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments: for therein is my
desire.

36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies: and not to covetousness.

37 O turn away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity: and quicken thou
me in thy way.

38 O stablish thy word in thy servant: that I may fear thee.

39 Take away the rebuke that I am afraid of: for thy judgements are
good.

40 Behold, my delight is in thy commandments: O quicken me in thy
righteousness.

_Et veniat super me_.

Let thy loving mercy come also unto me, O Lord: even thy salvation,
according unto thy word.

42 So shall I make answer unto my blasphemers: for my trust is in
thy word.

43 O take not the word of thy truth utterly out of my mouth: for my
hope is in thy judgements.

44 So shall I alway keep thy law: yea, for ever and ever.

45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy commandments.

46 I will speak of thy testimonies also, even before kings: and will
not be ashamed.

47 And my delight shall be in thy commandments: which I have loved.

48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have
loved: and my study shall be in thy statutes.

_Memor esto verbi tui_.

O think upon thy servant, as concerning thy word: wherein thou hast
caused me to put my trust.

50 The same is my comfort in my trouble: for thy word hath quickened
me.

51 The proud have had me exceedingly in derision: yet have I not
shrinked from thy law.

52 For I remembered thine everlasting judgements, O Lord: and
received comfort.

53 I am horribly afraid: for the ungodly that forsake thy law.

54 Thy statutes have been my songs: in the house of my pilgrimage.

55 I have thought upon thy Name, O Lord, in the night-season: and
have kept thy law.

56 This I had: because I kept thy commandments.

_Portio mea, Domine_.

Thou art my portion, O Lord: I have promised to keep thy law.

58 I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart:
O be merciful unto me, according to thy word.

59 I called mine own ways to remembrance: and turned my feet unto
thy testimonies.

60 I made haste, and prolonged not the time: to keep thy
commandments.

61 The congregations of the ungodly have robbed me: but I have not
forgotten thy law.

62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee: because of thy
righteous judgements.

63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee: and keep thy
commandments.

64 The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: O teach me thy statutes.

_Bonitatem fetisti_.

O Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant: according unto
thy word.

66 O learn me true understanding and knowledge: for I have believed
thy commandments.

67 Before I was troubled, I went wrong: but now have I kept thy word.

68 Thou art good and gracious: O teach me thy statutes.

69 The proud have imagined a lie against me: but I will keep thy
commandments with my whole heart.

70 Their heart is as fat as brawn: but my delight hath been in thy
law.

71 It is good for me that I have been in trouble: that I may learn
thy statutes.

72 The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me: than thousands of gold
and silver.

DAY 25 EVENING PRAYER

_Manus tuae fecerunt me_.

Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: O give me understanding,
that I may learn thy commandments.

74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me: because I have
put my trust in thy word.

75 I know, O Lord, that thy judgements are right: and that thou of
very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.

76 O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort: according to thy word
unto thy servant.

77 O let thy loving mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
law is my delight.

78 Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly about to
destroy me: but I will be occupied in thy commandments.

79 Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies: be turned
unto me.

80 O let my heart be sound in thy statutes: that I be not ashamed.

_Defecit anima mea_.

My soul hath longed for thy salvation: and I have a good hope
because of thy word.

82 Mine eyes long sore for thy word: saying, O when wilt thou
comfort me?

83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke: yet do I not forget
thy statutes.

84 How many are the days of thy servant: when wilt thou be avenged
of them that persecute me?

85 The proud have digged pits for me: which are not after thy law.

86 All thy commandments are true: they persecute me falsely; O be
thou my help.

87 They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I forsook not
thy commandments.

88 O quicken me after thy loving-kindness: and so shall I keep the
testimonies of thy mouth.

_In aeternum, Domine_.

O Lord, thy word: endureth for ever in heaven.

90 Thy truth also remaineth from one generation to another: thou
hast laid the foundation of the earth, and it abideth.

91 They continue this day according to thine ordinance: for all
things serve thee.

92 If my delight had not been in thy law: I should have perished in
my trouble.

93 I will never forget thy commandments: for with them thou hast
quickened me.

94 I am thine, O save me: for I have sought thy commandments.

95 The ungodly laid wait for me to destroy me: but I will consider
thy testimonies.

96 I see that all things come to an end: but thy commandment is
exceeding broad.

_Quomodo dilexi!_

Lord, what love have I unto thy law: all the day long is my study
in it.

98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
enemies: for they are ever with me.

99 I have more understanding than my teachers: for thy testimonies
are my study.

100 I am wiser than the aged: because I keep thy commandments.

101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way: that I may keep
thy word.

102 I have not shrunk from thy judgements: for thou teachest me.

103 O how sweet are thy words unto my throat: yea, sweeter than
honey unto my mouth.

104 Through thy commandments I get understanding: therefore I hate
all evil ways.

DAY 26 MORNING PRAYER

_Lucerna pedibus meis_.

Thy word is a lantern unto my feet: and a light unto my paths.

106 I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed: to keep thy righteous
judgements.

107 I am troubled above measure: quicken me, O Lord, according to
thy word.

108 Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O Lord:
and teach me thy judgements.

109 My soul is alway in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.

110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me: but yet I swerved not
from thy commandments.

111 Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage for ever: and
why? they are the very joy of my heart.

112 I have applied my heart to fulfil thy statutes alway: even unto
the end.

Iniquos odio habui.

I hate them that imagine evil things: but thy law do I love.

114 Thou art my defence and shield: and my trust is in thy word.

115 Away from me, ye wicked: I will keep the commandments of my God.

116 O stablish me according to thy word, that I may live: and let
me not be disappointed of my hope.

117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: yea, my delight shall be
ever in thy statutes.

118 Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes:
for they imagine but deceit.

119 Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross:
therefore I love thy testimonies.

120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee: and I am afraid of thy
judgements.

_Feci judicium_.

I deal with the thing that is lawful and right: O give me not over
unto mine oppressors.

122 Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good: that
the proud do me no wrong.

123 Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy health: and for
the word of thy righteousness.

124 O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy: and
teach me thy statutes.

125 I am thy servant, O grant me understanding: that I may know thy
testimonies.

126 It is time for thee, Lord, to lay to thine hand: for they have
destroyed thy law.

127 For I love thy commandments: above gold and precious stone.

128 Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments: and all false
ways I utterly abhor.

_Mirabilia_.

Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.

130 When thy word goeth forth: it giveth light and understanding
unto the simple.

131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath: for my delight was in
thy commandments.

132 O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me: as thou usest to
do unto those that love thy Name.

133 Order my steps in thy word: and so shall no wickedness have
dominion over me.

134 O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men: and so shall I
keep thy commandments.

135 Shew the light of thy countenance upon thy servant: and teach
me thy statutes.

136 Mine eyes gush out with water: because men keep not thy law.

_Justus es, Domine_.

Righteous art thou, O Lord: and true is thy judgement.

138 The testimonies that thou hast commanded: are exceeding
righteous and true.

139 My zeal hath even consumed me: because mine enemies have
forgotten thy words.

140 Thy word is tried to the uttermost: and thy servant loveth it.

141 I am small, and of no reputation: yet do I not forget thy
commandments.

142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness: and thy law
is the truth.

143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me: yet is my delight
in thy commandments.

144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: O grant me
understanding, and I shall live.

DAY 26 EVENING PRAYER

_Clamavi in toto corde meo_.

I call with my whole heart: hear me, O Lord, I will keep thy
statutes.

146 Yea, even unto thee do I call: help me, and I shall keep thy
testimonies.

147 Early in the morning do I cry unto thee: for in thy word is my
trust.

148 Mine eyes prevent the night-watches: that I might be occupied
in thy words.

149 Hear my voice, O Lord, according unto thy loving-kindness:
quicken me, according as thou art wont.

150 They draw nigh that of malice persecute me: and are far from
thy law.

151 Be thou nigh at hand, O Lord: for all thy commandments are true.

152 As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since: that
thou hast grounded them for ever.

_Vide humilitatem_.

O consider mine adversity, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy
law.

154 Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me: quicken me, according to
thy word.

155 Health is far from the ungodly: for they regard not thy statutes.

156 Great is thy mercy, O Lord: quicken me, as thou art wont.

157 Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me: yet do I not
swerve from thy testimonies.

158 It grieveth me when I see the transgressors: because they keep
not thy law.

159 Consider, O Lord, how I love thy commandments: O quicken me,
according to thy loving-kindness.

160 Thy word is true from everlasting: all the judgements of thy
righteousness endure for evermore.

_Principes persecuti sunt_.

Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth
in awe of thy word.

162 I am as glad of thy word: as one that findeth great spoils.

163 As for lies, I hate and abhor them: but thy law do I love.

164 Seven times a day do I praise thee: because of thy righteous
judgements.

165 Great is the peace that they have who love thy law: and they
are not offended at it.

166 Lord, I have looked for thy saving health: and done after thy
commandments.

167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies: and loved them exceedingly.

168 I have kept thy commandments and testimonies: for all my ways
are before thee.

_Appropinquet deprecatio_.

Let my complaint come before thee, O Lord: give me understanding,
according to thy word.

170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me, according to
thy word.

171 My lips shall speak of thy praise: when thou hast taught me thy
statutes.

172 Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word: for all thy commandments
are righteous.

173 Let thine hand help me: for I have chosen thy commandments.

174 I have longed for thy saving health, O Lord: and in thy law is
my delight.

175 O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee: and thy judgements
shall help me.

176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: O seek thy
servant, for I do not forget thy commandments.

DAY 27 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 120. _Ad Dominum_.

When I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.

2 Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful
tongue.

3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue:
even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.

4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to
have my habitation among the tents of Kedar.

5 My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.

6 I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make
them ready to battle.

PSALM 121. _Levavi oculos_.

I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.

2 My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee
will not sleep.

4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.

5 The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy
right hand;

6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by
night

7 The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he
that shall keep thy soul.

8 The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from
this time forth for evermore.

PSALM 122. _Laetatus sum_.

I was glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the
Lord.

2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.

3 Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.

4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to
testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.

5 For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of
David.

6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
thee.

7 Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.

8 For my brethren and companions sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.

9 Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do
thee good.

PSALM 123. _Ad te levavi oculos meos_.

Unto thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.

2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress:
even so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy
upon us.

3 Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly
despised.

4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and
with the despitefulness of the proud.

PSALM 124. _Nisi quia Dominus_.

If the Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say:
if the Lord himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;

2 They had swallowed us up quick: when they were so wrathfully
displeased at us.

3 Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our
soul.

4 The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.

5 But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey
unto their teeth.

6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler:
the snare is broken, and we are delivered.

7 Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven
and earth.

PSALM 125. _Qui confidunt_.

They that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount
Sion: which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.

2 The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round
about his people, from this time forth for evermore.

3 For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the
righteous: lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.

4 Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.

5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord
shall lead them forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon
Israel.

DAY 27 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 126. _In convertendo_.

When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like
unto them that dream.

2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.

3 Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things
for them.

4 Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we
rejoice.

5 Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.

6 They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.

7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good
seed: shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves
with him.

PSALM 127. _Nisi Dominus_.

Except the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that
build it.

2 Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.

3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late
take rest, arid eat the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his
beloved sleep.

4 Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift
that cometh of the Lord.

5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the
young children.

6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

PSALM 128.  _Beati omnes_.

Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.

2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee,
and happy shalt thou be.

3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine
house.

4 Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.

5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.

6 The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt
see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long.

7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon
Israel.

PSALM 129. _Saepe expugnaverunt_.

Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel
now say.

2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they
have not prevailed against me.

3 The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.

4 But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in
pieces.

5 Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil
will at Sion.

6 Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which
withereth afore it be plucked up;

7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth
up the sheaves his bosom.

8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you:
we wish you good luck in the Name of the Lord.

PSALM 130. _De profundis_.

Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.

2 O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.

3 If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O
Lord, who may abide it?

4 For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.

5 I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is
my trust.

6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say,
before the morning watch.

7 O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy:
and with him is plenteous redemption.

8 And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.

PSALM 131. _Domine, non est_.

O Lord, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.

2 I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for
me.

3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is
weaned from his mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.

4 O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.

DAY 28 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 132. _Memento, Domine_.

Lord, remember David: and all his trouble;

2 How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God
of Jacob;

3 I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up
into my bed;

4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to
slumber: neither the temples of my head to take any rest;

5 Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation
for the mighty God of Jacob.

6 Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.

7 We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before
his footstool.

8 Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy
strength.

9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints
sing with joyfulness.

10 For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine
Anointed.

11 The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not
shrink from it;

12 Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.

13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I
shall learn them: their children also shall sit upon thy seat for
evermore.

14 For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself:
he hath longed for her.

15 This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a
delight therein.

16 I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her
poor with bread.

17 I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice
and sing.

18 There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained
a lantern for mine Anointed.

19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon
himself shall his crown flourish.

PSALM 133. _Ecce, quam bonum!_

Behold, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell
together in unity!

2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
unto the beard: even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the
skirts of his clothing.

3 Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.

4 For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.

PSALM 134 _Ecce nunc_.

Behold now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;

2 Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the
courts of the house of our God.

3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.

4 The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of
Sion.

PSALM 135. _Laudate Nomen_.

O praise the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye
servants of the Lord;

2 Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house
of our God.

3 O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto
his Name, for it is lovely.

4 For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for
his own possession.

5 For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all
gods.

6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth:
and in the sea, and in all deep places.

7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and
sendeth forth lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of
his treasures.

8 He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.

9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou
land of Egypt: upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.

10 He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;

11 Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all
the kingdoms of Canaan;

12 And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto
Israel his people.

13 Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O
Lord, from one generation to another.

14 For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his
servants.

15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold:
the work of men's hands.

16 They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.

17 They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any
breath in their mouths.

18 They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that
put their trust in them.

19 Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel; praise the Lord, ye house
of Aaron.

20 Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise
the Lord.

PSALM 137. _Super flumina_.

By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered
thee, O Sion.

2 As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are
therein.

3 For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and
melody in our heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.

4 How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?

5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her
cunning.

6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth: yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.

7 Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem:
how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.

8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he
be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.

9 Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them
against the stones.

PSALM 138. _Confitebor tibi_.

I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.

2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name,
because of thy loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified
thy Name and thy word above all things.

3 When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul
with much strength.

4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they
have heard the words of thy mouth.

5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the
glory of the Lord.

6 For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
as for the proud, he beholdeth them afar off.

7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me:
thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine
enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

8 The Lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy
mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever; despise not then the works of
thine own hands.

DAY 29 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 139. _Domine, probasti_.

Lord, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my
down-sitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts
long before.

2 Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my
 ways.

3 For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord,
knowest it altogether.

4 Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon
me.

5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and excel lent for me: I cannot
attain unto it.

6 Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go
then from thy presence?

7 If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell,
thou art there also.

8 If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost
parts of the sea;

9 Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall
hold me.

10 If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall
my night be turned to day.

11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is
as clear as the day: the darkness and light to thee are both alike.

12 For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.

13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made: marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.

14 My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and
fashioned beneath in the earth.

15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy
book were all my members written;

16 Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of
them.

17 How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the
sum of them!

18 If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I
wake up I am present with thee.

19 Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye
blood-thirsty men.

20 For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take
thy Name in vain.

21 Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved
with those that rise up against thee?

22 Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine
enemies.

23 Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and
examine my thoughts.

24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me
in the way everlasting.

PSALM 140. _Eripe me, Domine_.

Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the
wicked man.

2 Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the
day long.

3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders poison
is under their lips.

4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly; preserve me from
the Wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.

5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad
with cords: yea, and set traps in my way.

6 I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
prayers, O Lord.

7 O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my
head in the day of battle.

8 Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his
mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.

9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them:
that compass me about.

10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
fire and into the pit, that they never rise up again.

11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall
hunt the wicked person to overthrow him,

12 Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the
cause of the helpless.

13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and
the just shall continue in thy sight.

PSALM 141. _Domine, clamavi_.

O Lord, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my
voice when I cry unto thee.

2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let
the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.

3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.

4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be
occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I
eat of such things as please them.

5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.

6 But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray
yet against their wickedness.

7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may
hear my words, for they are sweet.

8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one
breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.

9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust,
O cast not out my soul.

10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from
the traps of the wicked doers.

11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let
me ever escape them.

DAY 29 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 142. _Voce mea ad Dominum_.

I cried unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did
I make my supplication.

2 I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my
trouble.

3 When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the
way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

4 I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that
would know me.

5 I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.

6 I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my
portion in the land of the living.

7 Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.

8 O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.

9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy
Name: which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous
resort unto my company.

PSALM 143. _Domine, exaudi_. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and consider
my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth and righteousness sake.

2 And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy
sight shall no man living be justified.

3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
down to the ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that
have been long dead.

4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me
is desolate.

5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea,
I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.

6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as
a thirsty land.

7 Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide
not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into
the pit.

8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for
in thee is my trust: shew thou me the way that I should walk in,
for I lift up my soul unto thee.

9 Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to
hide me.

10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God:
let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.

11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness
sake bring my soul out of trouble.

12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them
that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.

DAY 30 MORNING PRAYER

PSALM 144. _Benedictus Dominus_.

Blessed be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war,
and my fingers to fight;

2 My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in
whom I trust: who subdueth my people that is under me.

3 Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the
son of man, that thou so regardest him?

4 Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.

5 Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.

6 Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows,
and consume them.

7 Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the
great waters, from the hand of strange children;

8 Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right
hand of wickedness.

9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto
thee upon a ten-stringed lute.

10 Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David
thy servant from the peril of the sword.

11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose
mouth talketh of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
iniquity.

12 That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our
daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple.

13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of
store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands
in our streets.

14 That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay:
no leading into captivity, and no complaining in our streets.

15 Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed
are the people who have the Lord for their God.

PSALM 145. _Exaltabo te, Deus_.

I will magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name
for ever and ever.

2 Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for
ever and ever.

3 Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is
no end of his greatness.

4 One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare
thy power.

5 As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy
praise, and wondrous works;

6 So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts:
and I will also tell of thy greatness.

7 The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and
men shall sing of thy righteousness.

8 The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great
goodness.

9 The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his
works.

10 All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks
unto thee.

11 They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;

12 That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom:
might be known unto men.

13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth
throughout all ages.

14 The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those
that are down.

15 The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them
their meat in due season.

16 Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with
plenteousness.

17 The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.

18 The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all
such as call upon him faithfully.

19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
hear their cry, and will help them.

20 The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth
abroad all the ungodly.

21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all
flesh give thanks unto his holy Name for ever and ever.

PSALM 146. _Lauda, anima mea_.

Praise the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord:
yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.

2 O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for
there is no help in them.

3 For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to
his earth: and then all his thoughts perish.

4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose
hope is in the Lord his God;

5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who
keepeth his promise for ever;

6 Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the
hungry.

7 The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the
blind.

8 The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the
righteous.

9 The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless
and widow: as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.

10 The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and
throughout all generations.

DAY 30 EVENING PRAYER

PSALM 147. _Laudate Dominum_.

O praise the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our
God: yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.

2 The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the
out-casts of Israel.

3 He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine
to heal their sickness.

4 He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by
their names.

5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom
is infinite.

6 The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to
the ground.

7 O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the
harp unto our God;

8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the
earth: and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb
for the use of men;

9 Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens
that call upon him.

10 He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither
delighteth he in any man's legs.

11 But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their
trust in his mercy.

12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.

13 For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed
thy children within thee.

14 He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the
flour of wheat.

15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word
runneth very swiftly.

16 He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like
ashes.

17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his
frost?

18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his
wind, and the waters flow.

19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto
Israel.

20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen
knowledge of his laws.

PSALM 148. _Laudate Dominum_.

O praise the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.

2 Praise him, all ye angels of his: praise him, all his host.

3 Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.

4 Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the
heavens.

5 Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and
they were made; he commanded, and they were created.

6 He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a
law which shall not be broken.

7 Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;

8 Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his
word;

9 Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;

10 Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;

11 Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of
the world;

12 Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name
of the Lord: for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above
heaven and earth.

13 He shall exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall
praise him: even the children of Israel, even the people that
serveth him.

PSALM 149. _Cantate Domino_.

O sing unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints
praise him.

2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of
Sion be joyful in their King.

3 Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto
him with tabret and harp.

4 For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the
meek-hearted.

5 Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their
beds.

6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword
in their hands;

7 To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;

8 To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of
iron.

9 That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour
have all his saints.

PSALM 150. _Laudate Dominum_.

O praise God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his
power.

2 Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his
excellent greatness.

3 Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the
lute and harp.

4 Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings
and pipe.

5 Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud
cymbals.

6 Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.




FORMS OF PRAYER

TO BE

USED AT SEA

_The Morning and Evening Service to be used daily at Sea shall be
the same which is appointed in the Book of Common Prayer_.

_These two following Prayers are to be also used in his Majesty's
Navy every day_.

O eternal Lord God, who alone spreadest out the heavens, and
rulest the raging of the sea; who hast compassed the waters with
bounds until day and night come to an end: Be pleased to receive
into thy Almighty and most gracious protection the persons of us
thy servants, and the Fleet in which we serve. Preserve us from
the dangers of the sea, and from the violence of the enemy; that
we may be a safeguard unto our most gracious Sovereign Lord, King
_GEORGE_, and his Dominions, and a security for such as pass on
the seas upon their lawful occasions; that the inhabitants of our
Island may in peace and quietness serve thee our God; and that we
may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land, with the
fruits of our labours; and with a thankful remembrance of thy
mercies to praise and glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

_The Collect_.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious
favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy
Name, and finally by thy mercy obtain everlasting life; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Prayers to be used in Storms at Sea_.

O most powerful and glorious Lord God, at whose command the winds
blow, and lift up the waves of the sea, and who stillest the rage
thereof: We thy creatures, but miserable sinners, do in this our
great distress cry unto thee for help: Save, Lord, or else we
perish. We confess, when we have been safe, and seen all things
quiet about us, we have forgot thee our God, and refused to hearken
to the still voice of thy word, and to obey thy commandments: But
now we see how terrible thou art in all thy works of wonder; the
great God to be feared above all: And therefore we adore thy Divine
Majesty, acknowledging thy power, and imploring thy goodness. Help,
Lord, and save us for thy mercy's sake in Jesus Christ thy Son,
our Lord. _Amen_.

_Or this:_

O most  glorious and gracious Lord God, who dwellest in heaven,
but beholdest all things below: Look down, we beseech thee, and
hear us, calling out of the depth of misery, and out of the jaws
of this death, which is ready now to swallow us up: Save, Lord,
or else we perish. The living, the living shall praise thee. O
send thy word of command to rebuke the raging winds, and the
roaring sea; that we, being delivered from this distress, may
live to serve thee, and to glorify thy Name all the days of our
life. Hear, Lord, and save us, for the infinite merits of our
blessed Saviour, thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. _Amen_.

_The Prayer to be said before a Fight at Sea against any Enemy_.

O most powerful and glorious Lord God, the Lord of hosts, that
rulest and commandest all things: Thou sittest in the throne
judging right, and therefore we make our address to thy Divine
Majesty in this our necessity, that thou wouldest take the cause
into thine own hand, and judge between us and our enemies. Stir
up thy strength, O Lord, and come and help us; for thou givest not
alway the battle to the strong, but canst save by many or by few.
O let not our sins now cry against us for vengeance; but hear us
thy poor servants begging mercy, and imploring thy help, and that
thou wouldest be a defence unto us against the face of the enemy.
Make it appear that thou art our Saviour and mighty Deliverer;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_General Prayers_.

_Short Prayers for single persons that cannot meet to join in
Prayer with others, by reason of the Fight, or Storm_.

Lord, be merciful to us sinners, and save us for thy mercy's sake.

Thou art the great God, that hast made and rulest all things: O
deliver us for thy Name's sake.

Thou art the great God to be feared above all: O save us, that we
may praise thee.

_Special Prayers with respect to the Enemy_.

Thou, O Lord, art just and powerful: O defend our cause against
the face of the enemy.

O God, thou art a strong tower of defence to all that flee unto
thee: O save us from the violence of the enemy.

O Lord of hosts, fight for us, that we may glorify thee.

O suffer us not to sink under the weight of our sins, or the
violence of the enemy.

O Lord, arise, help us, and deliver us for thy Name's sake.

_Short Prayers in respect of a Storm_.

Thou, O Lord, that stillest the raging of the sea: hear, hear us,
and save us, that we perish not.

O blessed Saviour, that didst save thy disciples ready to perish
in a storm: hear us, and save us, we beseech thee.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Christ, have mercy upon us.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

O Lord, hear us.

O Christ, hear us.

God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, have mercy upon
us, save us now and evermore. Amen.

Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and
the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.

_When there shall be imminent danger, as many as can be spared
from necessary service in the Ship shall be called together, and
make an humble Confession of their sin to God: In which every one
ought seriously to reflect upon those particular sins of which his
conscience shall accuse him: saying as followeth_.

_The Confession_.

Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all
things, Judge of all men: We acknowledge and bewail our manifold
sins and wickedness, Which we from time to time most grievously
have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against thy divine
Majesty, Provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against
us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these our
misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The burden
of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, Have mercy upon us,
most merciful Father; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
Forgive us all that is past; And grant that we may ever hereafter
Serve and please thee In newness of life, To the honour and glory
of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

_Then shall the Priest, if there be any in the Ship, pronounce
this Absolution_.

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy hath
promised forgiveness of sins to all them that with hearty repentance
and true faith turn unto him; Have mercy upon you; pardon and
deliver you from all your sins; confirm and strengthen you in all
goodness; and bring you to everlasting life; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. _Amen_.

_Thanksgiving after a Storm_.

_Jubilate Deo_. Psalm lxvi.

O be joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of
his Name, make his praise to be glorious.

Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.

For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy
Name.

O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in
his doing toward the children of men.

He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the
water on foot; there did we rejoice thereof.

He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and
such as will not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.

O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be
heard;

Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.

For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as
silver is tried.

Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our
loins.

Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire
and water, and thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee
my vows, which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth,
when I was in trouble.

I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of
rams: I will offer bullocks and goats.

O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell
you what he hath done for my soul.

I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.

If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not
hear me.

But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.

Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his
mercy from me.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_Confitemini Domino_. Psalm cvii.

O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy
endureth for ever.

Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered
from the hand of the enemy;

And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the
west: from the north and from the south.

They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no
city to dwell in;

Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.

So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered
them from their distress.

He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city
where they dwelt.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with
goodness.

Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast
bound in misery and iron;

Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly
regarded the counsel of the most Highest;

He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell
down, and there was none to help them up.

So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered
them out of their distress.

For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of
death: and brake their bonds in sunder.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of
iron in sunder.

Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their
wickedness.

Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard
at death's door.

So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered
them out of their distress.

He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their
destruction.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving:
and tell out his works with gladness!

They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business
in great waters;

These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.

For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the
waves thereof.

They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep:
their soul melteth away because of the trouble.

They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at
their wits end.

So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth
them out of their distress.

For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are
still.

Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth
them unto the haven where they would be.

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and
declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men!

That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people:
and praise him in the seat of the elders!

Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the
water-springs.

A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that
dwell therein.

Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs
of a dry ground.

And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city
to dwell in;

That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them
fruits of increase.

He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth
not their cattle to decrease.

And again, when they are minished and brought low: through
oppression, through any plague or trouble;

Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and
let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;

Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households
like a flock of sheep.

The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of
all wickedness shall be stopped.

Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand
the loving-kindness of the Lord.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without
end. Amen.

_Collects of Thanksgiving_.

O most blessed and glorious Lord God, who art of infinite goodness
and mercy: We thy poor creatures, whom thou hast made and preserved,
holding our souls in life, and now rescuing us out of the jaws of
death, humbly present ourselves again before thy Divine Majesty,
to offer a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, for that thou
heardest us when we called in our trouble, and didst not cast out
our prayer, which we made before thee in our great distress: Even
when we gave all for lost, our ship, our goods, our lives, then
didst thou mercifully look upon us, and wonderfully command a
deliverance; for which we, now being in safety, do give all praise
and glory to thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Or this:_

O most mighty and gracious good God, thy mercy is over all thy
works, but in special manner hath been extended toward us, whom
thou hast so powerfully and wonderfully defended. Thou hast shewed
us terrible things, and wonders in the deep, that we might see how
powerful and gracious a God thou art; how able and ready to help
them that trust in thee. Thou hast shewed us how both winds and
seas obey thy command; that we may learn, even from them, hereafter
to obey thy voice, and to do thy will. We therefore bless and
glorify thy Name, for this thy mercy in saving us, when we were
ready to perish. And, we beseech thee, make us as truly sensible
now of thy mercy, as we were then of the danger: and give us hearts
always ready to express our thankfulness, not only by words, but
also by our lives, in being more obedient to thy holy commandments.
Continue, we beseech thee, this thy goodness to us; that we, whom
thou hast saved, may serve thee in holiness and righteousness all
the days of our life; through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.
_Amen_.

_A Hymn of Praise and Thanksgiving after a dangerous Tempest_.

O come, let us give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and
his mercy endureth for ever.

Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; let the redeemed of
the Lord say so: whom he hath delivered from the merciless rage of
the sea.

The Lord is gracious and full of compassion: slow to anger, and of
great mercy.

He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: neither rewarded
us according to our iniquities.

But as the heaven is high above the earth: so great hath been his
mercy towards us.

We found trouble and heaviness: we were even at death's door.

The waters of the sea had well-nigh covered us: the proud waters
had well-nigh gone over our soul.

The sea roared: and the stormy wind lifted up the waves thereof.

We were carried up as it were to heaven, and then down again into
the deep: our soul melted within us, because of trouble;

Then cried we unto thee, O Lord: and thou didst deliver us out of
our distress.

Blessed be thy Name, who didst not despise the prayer of thy
servants: but didst hear our cry, and hast saved us.

Thou didst send forth thy commandment: and the windy storm ceased,
and was turned into a calm.

O let us therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare
the wonders that he hath done, and still doeth, for the children
of men.

Praised be the Lord daily: even the Lord that helpeth us, and
poureth his benefits upon us.

He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the
Lord by whom we have escaped death.

Thou, Lord, hast made us glad through the operation of thy hands:
and we will triumph in thy praise.

Blessed be the Lord God: even the Lord God, who only doeth wondrous
things;

And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and let every one
of us say, Amen, Amen.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

2 _Corinthians xiii_.

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. _Amen_.

_After Victory or Deliverance from an Enemy_.

_A Psalm or Hymn of Praise and Thanksgiving after Victory_.

If the Lord had not been on our side, now may we say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;

They had swallowed us up quick: when they were so wrathfully
displeased at us.

Yea, the waters had drowned us, and the stream had gone over our
soul: the deep waters of the proud had gone over our soul.

But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over as a prey unto
them.

The Lord hath wrought: a mighty salvation for us.

We gat not this by our own sword, neither was it our own arm that
saved us: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy
countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto us.

The Lord hath appeared for us: the Lord hath covered our heads,
and made us to stand in the day of battle.

The Lord hath appeared for us: the Lord hath overthrown our
enemies, and dashed in pieces those that rose up against us.

Therefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us: but unto thy Name be
given the glory.

The Lord hath done great things for us: the Lord hath done great
things for us, for which we rejoice.

Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven
and earth.

Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

_After this Hymn may be sung the TE DEUM_.

_Then this Collect_.

O almighty God, the sovereign Commander of all the world, in whose
hand is power and might which none is able to withstand: We bless
and magnify thy great and glorious Name for this happy victory,
the whole glory whereof we do ascribe to thee, who art the only
giver of victory. And, we beseech thee, give us grace to improve
this great mercy to thy glory, the advancement of thy Gospel, the
honour of our Sovereign, and, as much as in us lieth, to the good
of all mankind. And, we beseech thee, give us such a sense of this
great mercy, as may engage us to a true thankfulness, such as may
appear in our lives by an humble, holy, and obedient walking before
thee all our days, through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom with thee
and the Holy Spirit, as for all thy mercies, so in particular for
this victory and deliverance, be all glory and honour, world without
end. _Amen_.

AT THE BURIAL OF THEIR DEAD AT SEA

_The Office in the Common-Prayer-Book may be used: only instead of
these words_ [We therefore commit his body to the ground, earth to
earth, &c.] _say_,

We therefore commit his body to the deep, to be turned into
corruption, looking for the resurrection of the body, (when the
sea shall give up her dead,) and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ; who at his coming shall change our
vile body, that it may be like his glorious body, according to the
mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.




THE FORM AND MANNER

OF

MAKING ORDAINING AND CONSECRATING

OF

BISHOPS PRIESTS AND DEACONS

ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF

THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND


THE PREFACE.

It is evident unto all men diligently reading holy Scripture and
ancient Authors, that from the Apostles time there have been these
Orders of Ministers in Christ's Church; Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons. Which offices were evermore had in such reverend estimation,
that no man might presume to execute any of them, except he were
first called, tried, examined, and known to have such qualities as
are requisite for the same; and also by public Prayer, with
Imposition of Hands, were approved and admitted thereunto by
lawful authority. And therefore, to the intent that these Orders
may be continued, and reverently used and esteemed, in the Church
of England; No man shall be accounted or taken to be a lawful
Bishop, Priest, or Deacon in the Church of England, or suffered
to execute any of the said functions, except he be called, tried,
examined, and admitted thereunto, according to the Form hereafter
following, or hath had formerly Episcopal Consecration or Ordination.

And none shall be admitted a Deacon, except he be twenty-three years
of age, unless he have a Faculty. And every man which is to be
admitted a Priest shall be full four-and-twenty years old. And
every man which is to be ordained or consecrated Bishop shall be
fully thirty years of age.

And the Bishop, knowing either by himself, or by sufficient
testimony, any person to be a man of virtuous conversation, and
without crime; and after examination and trial finding him learned
in the Latin tongue, and sufficiently instructed in holy Scripture,
may at the times appointed in the Canon, or else, on urgent
occasion, upon some other Sunday or Holy-day, in the face of the
Church, admit him a Deacon, in such manner and form as hereafter
followeth.




FROM THE CANONS OF THE

SCOTTISH CHURCH


CANON II.

OF THE ORDERING OF BISHOPS, PRIESTS, AND DEACONS.

1. The Ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons shall be according
to the "Form and manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating of
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons" set forth together with the Book of
Common Prayer of the Church of England, with the following
alterations:

The reading of the King's mandate, the oath of the King's supremacy,
and the oath of obedience to the Archbishop shall be omitted. In
the interrogations the words "this Church" shall be substituted for
"this Realm" or "this Church of England" or "this Church and
Realm." At the ordination of Priests and Deacons, a Priest appointed
by the Bishop shall do what is directed in the Form to be done by
the Archdeacon. At the consecration of Bishops the Primus when
present shall do what is directed in the Form to be done by the
Archbishop, but in the absence of the Primus the senior Bishop
present shall act in his place unless it be otherwise unanimously
agreed by the Bishops present.

2. All ordinations of Priests and Deacons shall be held at the Ember
Seasons, unless, for reasons which may seem to him sufficient,
the Bishop shall appoint another time.

NOTE.

The portions of the following three forms which are modified in
Scotland are marked with square brackets.




THE

FORM AND MANNER

OF

MAKING OF DEACONS


_When the day appointed by the Bishop is come; after Morning Prayer
is ended, there shall be a Sermon or Exhortation, declaring the
duty and office of such as come to be admitted Deacons; how
necessary that Order is in the Church of Christ; and also how
the people ought to esteem them in their office_.

_First_, [_a Presbyter appointed by the Bishop_] _shall present
unto the Bishop_ (_sitting in his Chair, near to the holy Table_)
_such as desire to be ordained Deacons_, (_each of them being
decently habited_,) _saying these words_,

Reverend Father in God, I present unto you these persons present,
to be admitted Deacons.

_The Bishop_.

Take heed that the persons, whom ye present unto us, be apt and
meet, for their learning and godly conversation, to exercise their
ministry duly, to the honour of God, and the edifying of his Church.

[_The Presbyter_] _shall answer_,

I have enquired of them, and also examined them; and think them so
to be.

_Then the Bishop shall say unto the people:_

Brethren, if there be any of you who knoweth any impediment or
notable crime in any of these persons presented to be ordered
Deacons, for the which he ought not to be admitted to that office;
Let him come forth in the Name of God, and shew what the crime or
impediment is.

_And if any great crime or impediment be objected, the Bishop shall
surcease from ordering that person, until such time as the party
accused shall be found clear of that crime_.

_Then the Bishop_ (_commending such as shall be found meet to be
ordered to the prayers of the Congregation_) _shall, with the
Clergy and people present, sing or say the Litany, with the Prayers,
as followeth_.

_The Litany and Suffrages_.

O God the Father of heaven: have mercy upon us miserable sinners.

_O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, three Persons and one God:
have mercy upon us miserable sinners_.

Remember not, Lord, our offences, nor the offences of our forefathers;
neither take thou vengeance of our sins: spare us, good Lord, spare
thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and
be not angry with us for ever.

_Spare us, good Lord_.

From all evil and mischief; from sin, from the crafts and assaults
of the devil; from thy wrath, and from everlasting damnation,

from envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness,

deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

From lightning and tempest; from plague, pestilence, and famine;
from battle and murder, and from sudden death,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt
of thy Word and Commandment,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and
Circumcision; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

By thine Agony and bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy
precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and
Ascension; and by the coming of the Holy Ghost,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our wealth; in the
hour of death, and in the day of judgement,

_Good Lord, deliver us_.

Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom

day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, But
deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Priest_. O Lord, deal not with us after our sins.

_Answer_. Neither reward us after our iniquities.

Let us pray.

O God, merciful Father, that despisest not the sighing of a contrite
heart, nor the desire of such as be sorrowful: Mercifully assist
our prayers that we make before thee in all our troubles and
adversities, whensoever they oppress us; and graciously hear us,
that those evils, which the craft and subtilty of the devil or man
worketh against us, be brought to nought, and by the providence of
thy goodness they may be dispersed; that we thy servants, being
hurt by no persecutions, may evermore give thanks unto thee in thy
holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

_O Lord, arise, help us, and deliver us for thy Name's sake_.

O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared
unto us, the noble works that thou didst in their days, and in the
old time before them.

_O Lord, arise, help us, and deliver us for thine honour_.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;

_Answer_. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
world without end. Amen.

From our enemies defend us, O Christ.

_Graciously look upon our afflictions_.

Pitifully behold the sorrows of our hearts.

_Mercifully forgive the sins of thy people_.

Favourably with mercy hear our prayers.

_O Son of David, have mercy upon us_.

Both now and ever vouchsafe to hear us, O Christ.

_Graciously hear us, Christ; graciously hear us, O Lord Christ_.

_Priest_. O Lord, let thy mercy be shewed upon us;

_Answer_. As we do put our trust in thee.

Let us pray.

We humbly beseech thee, O Father, merci fully to look upon our
infirmities; and for the glory of thy Name turn from us all those
evils that we most righteously have deserved; and grant that in
all our troubles we may put our whole trust and confidence in thy
mercy, and evermore serve thee in holiness and pureness of living,
to thy honour and glory; through our only Mediator and Advocate,
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall be sung or said the Service for the Communion, with
the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, as followeth_.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, who by thy divine providence hast appointed divers
Orders of Ministers in thy Church, and didst inspire thine Apostles
to choose into the Order of Deacons the first Martyr Saint Stephen,
with others: Mercifully behold these thy servants now called to
the like office and administration; replenish them so with the
truth of thy doctrine, and adorn them with innocency of life, that,
both by word and good example, they may faithfully serve thee in
this office, to the glory of thy Name, and the edification of thy
Church; through the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth
and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, now and for ever. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Tim. iii. 8.

Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given
to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience. And let these also first be proved;
then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful
in all things. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling
their children and their own houses well. For they that have used
the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree,
and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

_Or else this, out of the sixth of the Acts of the Apostles_.

Acts vi. 2.

Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,
and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God,
and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you
seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,
whom we may appoint over this business. But we will give ourselves
continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. And the
saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man
full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus,
and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of
Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had
prayed, they laid their hands on them. And the word of God increased
and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly;
and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

_And before the Gospel, the Bishop, sitting in his Chair, shall
examine every one of them that are to be ordered, in the presence
of the people after this manner following_.

Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take
upon you this office and ministration, to serve God, for the
promoting of his glory, and the edifying of his people?

_Answer_. I trust so.

_The Bishop_.

Do you think that you are truly called, according to the will of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and the due order of this [Church], to the
Ministry of the Church?

_Answer_. I think so.

_The Bishop_.

Do you unfeignedly believe all the Canonical Scriptures of the Old
and New Testament?

_Answer_. I do believe them.

_The Bishop_.

Will you diligently read the same unto the people assembled in the
Church where you shall be appointed to serve?

_Answer_. I will.

_The Bishop_.

It appertaineth to the office of a Deacon, in the Church where he
shall be appointed to serve, to assist the Priest in Divine Service,
and specially when he ministereth the holy Communion, and to help
him in the distribution thereof, and to read holy Scriptures and
Homilies in the Church; and to instruct the youth in the Catechism;
in the absence of the Priest to baptize infants; and to preach, if
he be admitted thereto by the Bishop. And furthermore, it is his
office, where provision is so made, to search for the sick, poor,
and impotent people of the Parish, to intimate their estates,
names, and places where they dwell, unto the Curate, that by his
exhortation they may be relieved with the alms of the Parishioners,
or others. Will you do this gladly and willingly?

_Answer_. I will so do, by the help of God.

_The Bishop_.

Will you apply all your diligence to frame and fashion your own
lives, and the lives of your families, according to the doctrine
of Christ; and to make both yourselves and them, as much as in you
lieth, wholesome examples of the flock of Christ?

_Answer_. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.

_The Bishop_.

Will you reverently obey your Ordinary, and other chief Ministers
of the Church, and them to whom the charge and government over you
is committed, following with a glad mind and will their godly
admonitions?

_Answer_. I will endeavour myself, the Lord being my helper.

_Then the Bishop laying his hands severally upon the head of every
one of them, humbly kneeling before him, shall say_,

Take thou authority to execute the office of a Deacon in the Church
of God committed unto thee; In the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_Then shall the Bishop deliver to every one of them the New
Testament, saying_,

Take thou authority to read the Gospel in the Church of God, and
to preach the same, if thou be thereto licensed by the Bishop
himself.

_Then one of them, appointed by the Bishop, shall read_

THE GOSPEL. St Luke xii. 35.

Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye
yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will
return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they
may open unto him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom
the lord when he cometh shall find watching. Verily I say unto
you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat,
and will come forth and serve them. And if he shall come in the
second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed
are those servants.

_Then shall the Bishop proceed in the Communion: and all that are
ordered shall tarry, and receive the holy Communion the same day
with the Bishop_.

_The Communion ended, after the last Collect, and immediately before
the Benediction, shall be said these Collects following_.

Almighty God, giver of all good things, who of thy great goodness
hast vouchsafed to accept and take these thy servants unto the
office of Deacons in thy Church: Make them, we beseech thee, O Lord,
to be modest, humble, and constant in their ministration; to have
a ready will to observe all spiritual discipline; that they having
always the testimony of a good conscience, and continuing ever
stable and strong in thy Son Christ, may so well behave themselves
in this inferior office, that they may be found worthy to be called
unto the higher ministries in thy Church; through the same thy Son
our Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honour world without
end. _Amen_.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy most gracious favour,
and further us with thy continual help; that in all our works,
begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy Name,
and finally by thy mercy obtain everlasting life; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord: And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and remain with you always.
_Amen_.

_And here it must be declared unto the Deacon, that he must
continue in that office of a Deacon the space of a whole year_
(_except for reasonable causes it shall otherwise seem good unto
the Bishop_) _to the intent he may be perfect, and well expert in
the things appertaining to the Ecclesiastical Administration. In
executing whereof if he be found faithful and diligent, he may be
admitted by his Diocesan to the Order of Priesthood, at the times
appointed in the Canon; or else, on urgent occasion, upon some
other Sunday or Holy-day, in the face of the Church, in such manner
and form as hereafter followeth_.




THE

FORM AND MANNER

OF

ORDERING OF PRIESTS


_When the day appointed by the Bishop is come; after Morning Prayer
is ended, there shall be a Sermon or Exhortation, declaring the duty
and office of such as come to be admitted Priests; how necessary
that Order is in the Church of Christ; and also how the people
ought to esteem them in their office_.

_First_, [_a Presbyter appointed by the Bishop_] _shall present
unto the Bishop_ (_sitting in his Chair, near to the holy Table_)
_all them that shall receive the Order of Priesthood that day;_
(_each of them being decently habited;_) _and say_,

Reverend Father in God, I present unto you these persons present,
to be admitted to the Order of Priesthood.

_The Bishop_.

Take heed that the persons, whom ye present unto us, be apt and
meet, for their learning and godly conversation, to exercise their
ministry duly, to the honour of God, and the edifying of his Church.

[_The Presbyter_] _shall answer_,

I have enquired of them, and also examined them; and think them so
to be.

_Then the Bishop shall say unto the people_:

Good people, these are they whom we purpose, God willing, to
receive this day unto the holy office of Priesthood: For after
due examination we find not to the contrary, but that they be
lawfully called to their function and ministry, and that they be
persons meet for the same. But yet if there be any of you, who
knoweth any impediment or notable crime in any of them, for the
which he ought not to be received into this holy ministry; Let
him come forth in the Name of God, and shew what the crime or
impediment is.

_And if any great crime or impediment be objected, the Bishop shall
surcease from ordering that person, until such time as the party
accused shall be found clear of that crime_.

_Then the Bishop_ (_commending such as shall be found meet to be
ordered to the prayers of the Congregation_) _shall, with the
Clergy and people present, sing or say the Litany, with the Prayers,
as is before appointed in the Form of Ordering Deacons; save only,
that, in the proper Suffrage there added, the word_ Deacons _shall
be omitted, and the word_ Priests _inserted instead of it_.

_Then shall be sung or said the Service for the Communion, with the
Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, as followeth_.

THE COLLECT.

Almighty God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit
hast appointed divers Orders of Ministers in thy Church: Mercifully
behold these thy servants now called to the office of Priesthood;
and replenish them so with the truth of thy doctrine, and adorn
them with innocency of life, that, both by word and good example,
they may faithfully serve thee in this office, to the glory of thy
Name, and the edification of thy Church; through the merits of our
Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the
Holy Ghost, world without end. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. Ephes. iv. 7.

Unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of
the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high,
he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he
ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the
lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that
ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists,
and some Pastors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the saints for
the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ;
till we all come, in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
of the fulness of Christ.

_After this shall be read for the Gospel part of the ninth chapter
of Saint Matthew, as followeth_.

_St Matth_. ix. 36.

When Jesus saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep
having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest
truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore
the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into
his harvest.

_Or else this that followeth, out of the tenth chapter of Saint
John_.

St John x. 1.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is
a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the
shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep
hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth
them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before
them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a
stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they
know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake Jesus unto
them, but they understood not what things they were which he spake
unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me
are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the
door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go
in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not but for to
steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might
have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the
good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The
hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the
sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are
not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my
voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

_Then the Bishop, sitting in his Chair, shall say unto them as
hereafter followeth_.

You have heard, brethren, as well in your private examination,
as in the exhortation which was now made to you, and in the holy
Lessons taken out of the Gospel and the writings of the Apostles,
of what dignity and of how great importance this office is,
whereunto ye are called. And now again we exhort you, in the Name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you have in remembrance, into how
high a dignity, and to how weighty an office and charge ye are
called: that is to say, to be messengers, watchmen, and stewards
of the Lord; to teach and to premonish, to feed and provide for
the Lord's family; to seek for Christ's sheep that are dispersed
abroad, and for his children who are in the midst of this naughty
world, that they may be saved through Christ for ever.

Have always therefore printed in your remembrance, how great
a treasure is committed to your charge. For they are the sheep
of Christ, which he bought with his death, and for whom he shed
his blood. The Church and Congregation whom you must serve, is
his spouse and his body. And if it shall happen the same Church,
or any member thereof, to take any hurt or hindrance by reason
of your negligence, ye know the greatness of the fault, and also
the horrible punishment that will ensue. Wherefore consider with
yourselves the end of your ministry towards the children of God,
towards the spouse and body of Christ; and see that you never
cease your labour, your care and diligence, until you have done
all that lieth in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring
all such as are or shall be committed to your charge, unto that
agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeness
and perfectness of age in Christ, that there be no place left
among you, either for error in religion, or for viciousness in
life.

Forasmuch then as your office is both of so great excellency and of
so great difficulty, ye see with how great care and study ye ought
to apply yourselves, as well that ye may shew yourselves dutiful
and thankful unto that Lord, who hath placed you in so high a
dignity; as also to beware that neither you yourselves offend,
nor be occasion that others offend. Howbeit, ye cannot have a mind
and will thereto of yourselves; for that will and ability is given
of God alone. Therefore ye ought, and have need, to pray earnestly
for his Holy Spirit. And seeing that you cannot by any other means
compass the doing of so weighty a work, pertaining to the salvation
of man, but with doctrine and exhortation taken out of the holy
Scriptures, and with a life agreeable to the same; consider how
studious ye ought to be in reading and learning the Scriptures,
and in framing the manners both of yourselves, and of them that
specially pertain unto you, according to the rule of the same
Scriptures: and for this self-same cause, how ye ought to forsake
and set aside (as much as you may) all worldly cares and studies.

We have good hope that you have well weighed and pondered these
things with yourselves long before this time; and that you have
clearly determined, by God's grace, to give yourselves wholly to
this office, whereunto it hath pleased God to call you: so that,
as much as lieth in you, you will apply yourselves wholly to this
one thing, and draw all your cares and studies this way; and that
you will continually pray to God the Father, by the mediation of
our only Saviour Jesus Christ, for the heavenly assistance of the
Holy Ghost; that, by daily reading and weighing of the Scriptures,
ye may wax riper and stronger in your ministry; and that ye may
so endeavour yourselves from time to time to sanctify the lives
of you and yours, and to fashion them after the rule and doctrine
of Christ, that ye may be wholesome and godly examples and patterns
for the people to follow.

And now, that this present Congregation of Christ here assembled
may also understand your minds and wills in these things, and that
this your promise may the more move you to do your duties, ye shall
answer plainly to these things, which we, in the Name of God, and
of his Church, shall demand of you touching the same.

Do you think in your heart that you be truly called, according to
the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the order of [this Church],
to the Order and Ministry of Priesthood?

_Answer_. I think it.

_The Bishop_.

Are you persuaded that the holy Scriptures contain sufficiently
all doctrine required of necessity for eternal salvation through
faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined out of the said
Scriptures to instruct the people committed to your charge, and
to teach nothing (as required of necessity to eternal salvation)
but that which you shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved
by the Scripture?

_Answer_. I am so persuaded, and have so determined by God's grace.

_The Bishop_.

Will you then give your faithful diligence always so to minister
the doctrine and sacraments, and the discipline of Christ, as
the Lord hath commanded, and as [this Church] hath received the
same, according to the commandments of God; so that you may teach
the people committed to your cure and charge with all diligence
to keep and observe the same?

_Answer_. I will so do, by the help of the Lord.

_The Bishop_.

Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and
drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's
Word; and to use both public and private monitions and exhortations,
as well to the sick as to the whole, within your cures, as need
shall require, and occasion shall be given?

_Answer_. I will, the Lord being my helper.

_The Bishop_.

Will you be diligent in prayers, and in reading of the holy
Scriptures, and in such studies as help to the knowledge of the
same, laying aside the study of the world and the flesh?

_Answer_. I will endeavour myself so to do, the Lord being my
helper.

_The Bishop_.

Will you be diligent to frame and fashion your own selves, and
your families, according to the doctrine of Christ; and to make
both yourselves and them, as much as in you lieth, wholesome
examples and patterns to the flock of Christ?

_Answer_. I will apply myself thereto, the Lord being my helper.

_The Bishop_.

Will you maintain and set forwards, as much as lieth in you,
quietness, peace, and love, among all Christian people, and
specially among them that are or shall be committed to your charge?

_Answer_. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.

_The Bishop_.

Will you reverently obey your Ordinary, and other chief Ministers,
unto whom is committed the charge and government over you;
following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions, and
submitting yourselves to their godly judgements?

_Answer_. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.

_Then shall the Bishop, standing up, say_,

Almighty God, who hath given you this will to do all these things;
Grant also unto you strength and power to perform the same; that
he may accomplish his work which he hath begun in you; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_After this, the Congregation shall be desired, secretly in their
prayers, to make their humble supplications to God for all these
things: for the which prayers there shall be silence kept for a
space_.

_After which shall be sung or said by the Bishop_ (_the persons to
be ordained Priests all kneeling_) Veni, Creator Spiritus; _the
Bishop beginning, and the Priests, and others that are present,
answering by verses, as followeth_.

Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,

_And lighten with celestial fire_.

Thou the anointing Spirit art,

_Who dost thy seven-fold gifts impart_.

Thy blessed Unction from above

_Is comfort, life, and fire of love_.

Enable with perpetual light

_The dulness of our blinded sight_

Anoint and cheer our soiled face

_With the abundance of thy grace_.

Keep far our foes, give peace at home:

_Where thou art guide, no ill can come_.

Teach us to know the Father, Son,

_And thee, of both, to be but one_.

That, through the ages all along,

_This may be our endless song_:

Praise to thy eternal merit,

_Father, Son, and Holy Spirit_.

_Or this_:

Come, Holy Ghost, eternal God, proceeding from above,

_Both from the Father and the Son, the God of peace and love_;

Visit our minds, into our hearts thy heavenly grace inspire;

_That truth and godliness we may pursue with full desire_.

Thou art the very Comforter in grief and all distress;

_The heav'nly gift of God most high, no tongue can it express_;

The fountain and the living spring of joy celestial;

_The fire so bright, the love so sweet, the unction spiritual_.

Thou in thy gifts art manifold, by them Christ's Church doth stand:

_In faithful hearts thou writ'st thy law, the finger of God's hand_.

According to thy promise, Lord, thou givest speech with grace;

_That through thy help God's praises may resound in every place_.

O Holy Ghost, into our minds send down thy heav'nly light;

_Kindle our hearts with fervent zeal to serve God day and night_.

Our weakness strengthen and confirm, (for, Lord, thou know'st us
frail;)

_That neither devil, world, nor flesh, against us may prevail_.

Put back our enemy far from us, and help us to obtain

_Peace in our hearts with God and man_, (_the best, the truest
gain_;)

And grant that thou being, O Lord, our leader and our guide,

_We may escape the snares of sin, and never from thee slide_.

Such measures of thy powerful grace grant, Lord, to us, we pray;

_That thou may'st be our Comforter at the last dreadful day_.

Of strife and of dissension dissolve, O Lord, the bands,

_And knit the knots of peace and love throughout all Christian
lands_.

Grant us the grace that we may know the Father of all might,

_That we of his beloved Son may gain the blissful sight_;

And that we may with perfect faith ever acknowledge thee,

_The Spirit of Father, and of Son, One God in Persons Three_.

To God the Father laud and praise, and to his blessed Son,

_And to the Holy Spirit of grace, co-equal Three in One_.

And pray we, that our only Lord would please his Spirit to send

_On all that shall profess his Name, from hence to the world's
end. Amen_.

_That done, the Bishop shall pray in this wise, and say_,

Let us pray.

Almighty God and heavenly Father, who of thine infinite love and
goodness towards us hast given to us thy only and most dearly
beloved Son Jesus Christ, to be our Redeemer and the Author of
everlasting life; who, after he had made perfect our redemption
by his death, and was ascended into heaven, sent abroad into the
world his Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Doctors, and Pastors,
by whose labour and ministry he gathered together a great flock
in all the parts of the world, to set forth the eternal praise of
thy holy Name: For these so great benefits of thy eternal goodness,
and for that thou hast vouchsafed to call these thy servants here
present to the same office and ministry, appointed for the salvation
of mankind, we render unto thee most hearty thanks, we praise and
worship thee; and we humbly beseech thee, by the same thy blessed
Son, to grant unto all, which either here or elsewhere call upon
thy holy Name, that we may continue to shew ourselves thankful unto
thee for these and all other thy benefits; and that we may daily
increase and go forwards in the knowledge and faith of thee and
thy Son, by the Holy Spirit. So that as well by these thy Ministers,
as by them over whom they shall be appointed thy Ministers, thy
holy Name may be for ever glorified, and thy blessed kingdom
enlarged; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who
liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the same Holy Spirit,
world without end. _Amen_.

_When this prayer is done, the Bishop with the Priests present
shall lay their hands severally upon the head of every one that
receiveth the Order of Priesthood; the receivers humbly kneeling
upon their knees, and the Bishop saying_,

Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a Priest in the
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of our
hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose
sins thou dost retain, they are retained. And be thou a faithful
dispenser of the Word of God, and of his holy Sacraments; In the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

_Then the Bishop shall deliver to every one of them kneeling the
Bible into his hand, saying_,

Take thou authority to preach the Word of God, and to minister
the holy Sacraments in the Congregation, where thou shalt be
lawfully appointed thereunto.

_When this is done, the Nicene Creed shall be sung or said; and
the Bishop shall after that go on in the Service of the Communion,
which all they that receive Orders shall take together, and remain
in the same place where hands were laid upon them, until such time
as they have received the Communion_.

_The Communion being done, after the last Collect, and immediately
before the Benediction, shall be said these Collects_.

Most merciful Father, we beseech thee to send upon these thy
servants thy heavenly blessing, that they may be clothed with
righteousness, and that thy Word spoken by their mouths may have
such success, that it may never be spoken in vain. Grant also that
we may have grace to hear and receive what they shall deliver out
of thy most holy Word, or agreeable to the same, as the means of
our salvation; that in all our words and deeds we may seek thy
glory, and the increase of thy kingdom; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. _Amen_.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy most gracious
favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works, begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy
holy Name, and finally by thy mercy obtain everlasting life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord: And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and remain with you always.
_Amen_.

_And if on the same day the Order of Deacons be given to some, and
the Order of Priesthood to others; the Deacons shall be first
presented, and then the Priests: and it shall suffice that the
Litany be once said for both. The Collects shall both be used;
first that for Deacons, then that for Priests. The Epistle shall
be Ephes. iv_. 7-13, _as before in this Office. Immediately after
which, they that are to be made Deacons shall be examined and
ordained, as is above prescribed. Then one of them having read the

before in this Office; or else St Luke xii_. 35-38, _as before in
the Form for the Ordering of Deacons,_) _they that are to be made

Almighty God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to thy holy
Apostles many excellent gifts, and didst charge them to feed thy
flock: Give grace, we beseech thee, to all Bishops, the Pastors
of thy Church, that they may diligently preach thy Word, and duly
administer the godly discipline thereof; and grant to the people,
that they may obediently follow the same; that all may receive the
crown of everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

THE EPISTLE. 1 Tim. iii. 1.

This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop,
he desireth a good work. A bishop then must be blameless, the
husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given
to hospitality, apt to teach; not given to wine, no striker, not
greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
subjection with all gravity; (for if a man know not how to rule
his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of God?) Not
a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must have a good report
of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the
snare of the devil.

_Or this_

FOR THE EPISTLE. Acts xx. 17.

From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the
Church. And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye
know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner
I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all
humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which
befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept back
nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and
have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both
to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and
faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. And now behold, I go bound in
the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befal
me there; save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying
that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move
me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish
my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the
Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God. And now
behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the
kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. Wherefore I take you to
record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I
have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take
heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock over the which
the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God,
which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that
after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not
sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore
watch, and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not
to warn every one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I
commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to
build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which
are sanctified. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or
apparel: yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered
unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. I have shewed
you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak;
and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is
more blessed to give than to receive.

_Then another Bishop shall read_

THE GOSPEL. St John xxi. 15.

Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me
more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that
I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him
again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He
saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He
saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time,
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because
he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said
unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I
love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

_Or else this_.

St John xx. 19.

The same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when
the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto
them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto
them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when
they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto
you: As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he
had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive
ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

_Or this_.

St Matth. xxviii. 18.

Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the world.

_After the Gospel, and the Nicene Creed, and the Sermon are ended,
the elected Bishop_ (_vested with his Rochet_) _shall be presented
by two Bishops unto the_ [_Primus_] (_or to some other Bishop
appointed by lawful commission_,) _the_ [_Primus_] _sitting in
his Chair, near the holy Table, and the Bishops that present him
saying_,

Most reverend Father in God, we present unto you this godly and
well-learned man to be ordained and consecrated Bishop.

[_Then shall the Archbishop demand the King's Mandate for the
Consecration, and cause it to be read. And then shall be ministered
unto them the Oath of due obedience to the Archbishop, as
followeth_.

_The Oath of due obedience to the Archbishop_.

In the Name of God, Amen. _N_. chosen Bishop of the Church and
See of _N_. do profess and promise all due reverence and obedience
to the Archbishop and to the Metropolitical Church of _N_. and
to their Successors: So help me God, through Jesus Christ.

_This Oath shall not be made at the Consecration of an Archbishop_.]

_Then the_ [_Primus_] _shall move the Congregation present to
pray, saying thus to them_:

Brethren, it is written in the Gospel of St Luke, that our Saviour
Christ continued the whole night in prayer, before he did choose
and send forth his twelve Apostles. It is written also in the
Acts of the Apostles, that the disciples who were at Antioch did
fast and pray, before they laid hands on Paul and Barnabas, and
sent them forth. Let us therefore, following the example of our
Saviour Christ and his Apostles, first fall to prayer, before we
admit and send forth this person presented unto us, to the work
whereunto we trust the Holy Ghost hath called him.

_And then shall be said the Litany, as before in the Form of
Ordering Deacons, save only that after this place_, That it may
please thee to illuminate all Bishops, &c. _the proper Suffrage
there following shall be omitted, and this inserted instead of it_;

That it may please thee to bless this our Brother elected, and to
send thy grace upon him, that he may duly execute the office where
unto he is called, to the edifying of thy Church, and to the honour,
praise and glory of thy Name,

_Answer_. We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.

_Then shall be said this Prayer following_.

Almighty God, giver of all good things, who by thy Holy Spirit hast
appointed divers orders of Ministers in thy Church: Mercifully
behold this thy servant now called to the work and ministry of a
Bishop; and replenish him so with the truth of thy doctrine, and
adorn him with innocency of life, that both by word and deed he
may faithfully serve thee in this office, to the glory of thy
Name, and the edifying and well-governing of thy Church; through
the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the Holy Ghost, world without end. _Amen_.

_Then the_ [_Primus_], _sitting in his Chair, shall say to him
that is to be consecrated_,

Brother, forasmuch as the holy Scripture and the ancient Canons
command that we should not be hasty in laying on hands, and
admitting any person to government in the Church of Christ, which
he hath purchased with no less price than the effusion of his
own blood: Before I admit you to this administration, I will
examine you in certain articles, to the end that the Congregation
present may have a trial, and bear witness, how you be minded to
behave yourself in the Church of God.

Are you persuaded that you be truly called to this ministration,
according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the order of
this [Church]?

_Answer_. I am so persuaded.

_The_ [_Primus_],

Are you persuaded that the holy Scriptures contain sufficiently
all doctrine required of necessity for eternal salvation through
faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined out of the same
holy Scriptures to instruct the people committed to your charge,
and to teach or maintain nothing as required of necessity to
eternal salvation, but that which you shall be persuaded may
be concluded and proved by the same?

_Answer_. I am so persuaded and determined, by God's grace.

_The_ [_Primus_].

Will you then faithfully exercise yourself in the same holy
Scriptures, and call upon God by prayer, for the true understanding
of the same; so as you may be able by them to teach and exhort
with wholesome doctrine, and to withstand and convince the
gainsayers?

_Answer_. I will so do, by the help of God

_The_ [_Primus_].

Be you ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and drive
away all erroneous and strange doctrine contrary to God's Word;
and both privately and openly to call upon and encourage others
to the same?

_Answer_. I am ready, the Lord being my helper.

_The_ [_Primus_].

Will you deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live soberly,
righteously and godly in this present world; that you may shew
yourself in all things an example of good works unto others, that
the adversary may be ashamed, having nothing to say against you?

_Answer_. I will so do, the Lord being my helper.

_The_ [_Primus_].

Will you maintain and set forward, as much as shall lie in you,
quietness, peace, and love among all men; and such as be unquiet,
disobedient and criminous within your Diocese, correct and punish,
according to such authority as you have by God's Word, and as to
you shall be committed by the Ordinance of this [Church]?

_Answer_. I will so do, by the help of God

_The_ [_Primus_].

Will you be faithful in ordaining, sending, or laying hands upon
others?

_Answer_. I will so be, by the help of God.

_The_ [_Primus_].

Will you shew yourself gentle, and be merciful for Christ's sake
to poor and needy people, and to all strangers destitute of help?

_Answer_. I will so shew myself, by God's help.

_Then the_ [_Primus_], _standing up, shall say_,

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who hath given you a good will
to do all these things; Grant also unto you strength and power to
perform the same; that he accomplishing in you the good work which h
e hath begun, you may be found perfect and irreprehensible at the
latter day; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_Then shall the Bishop elect put on the rest of the Episcopal
habit; and kneeling down_, Veni, Creator Spiritus, _shall be sung
or said over him, the_ [_Primus_] _beginning, and the Bishops,
with others that are present, answering by verses, as followeth_.

Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,

_And lighten with celestial fire_.

Thou the anointing Spirit art,

_Who dost thy seven-fold gifts impart_.

Thy blessed Unction from above

_Is comfort, life, and fire of love_.

Enable with perpetual light

_The dulness of our blinded sight_.

Anoint and cheer our soiled face

_With the abundance of thy grace_.

Keep far our foes, give peace at home:

_Where thou art guide, no ill can come_.

Teach us to know the Father, Son,

_And thee, of both, to be but one_.

That, through the ages all along,

_This may be our endless song_:

Praise to thy eternal merit,

_Father, Son, and Holy Spirit_.

_Or this_:

Come, Holy Ghost, eternal God, &c.

_as before in the Form of Ordering Priests_.

_That ended, the_ [_Primus_] _shall say_,

Lord, hear our prayer.

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

Let us pray.

Almighty God and most merciful Father, who of thine infinite
goodness hast given thine only and dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ,
to be our Redeemer and the Author of everlasting life; who, after
that he had made perfect our redemption by his death, and was
ascended into heaven, poured down his gifts abundantly upon men,
making some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some
Pastors and Doctors, to the edifying and making perfect his
Church: Grant, we beseech thee, to this thy servant such grace,
that he may evermore be ready to spread abroad thy Gospel, the
glad tidings of reconciliation with thee; and use the authority
given him, not to destruction, but to salvation; not to hurt, but
to help: so that as a wise and faithful servant, giving to thy
family their portion in due season, he may at last be received
into everlasting joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee
and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth one God, world without end.
_Amen_.

_Then the_ [_Primus and_] _Bishops present shall lay their hands
upon the head of the elected Bishop kneeling before them upon his
knees, the_ [_Primus_] _saying_,

Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a Bishop in the
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of our
hands; In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen. And remember that thou stir up the grace of God which
is given thee by this imposition of our hands: for God hath not
given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and soberness.

_Then the_ [_Primus_] _shall deliver him the Bible, saying_,

Give heed unto reading, exhortation, and doctrine. Think upon the
things contained in this Book. Be diligent in them, that the
increase coming thereby may be manifest unto all men. Take heed
unto thyself, and to doctrine, and be diligent in doing them: for
by so doing thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.
Be to the flock of Christ a shepherd, not a wolf; feed them, devour
them not. Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken,
bring again the outcasts, seek the lost. Be so merciful, that you
be not too remiss; so minister discipline, that you forget not
mercy: that when the chief Shepherd shall appear you may receive
the never-fading crown of glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
_Amen_.

_Then the_ [_Primus_] _shall proceed in the Communion Service; with
whom the new consecrated Bishop_ (_with others_) _shall also
communicate_.

_And for the last Collect, immediately before the Benediction,
shall be said these Prayers_.

Most merciful Father, we beseech thee to send down upon this thy
servant thy heavenly blessing; and so endue him with thy Holy
Spirit, that he, preaching thy Word, may not only be earnest to
reprove, beseech, and rebuke with all patience and doctrine; but
also may be to such as believe a wholesome example, in word, in
conversation, in love, in faith, in chastity, and in purity;
that, faithfully fulfilling his course, at the latter day he may
receive the crown of righteousness laid up by the Lord the
righteous Judge, who liveth and reigneth one God with the Father
and the Holy Ghost, world without end. _Amen_.

Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with I thy most gracious
favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our
works, begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy
Name, and finally by thy mercy obtain everlasting life; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your
hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord: And the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and
remain with you always. _Amen_.

_GEORGE_, _as on this day_, set over us by thy grace and providence
to be our King; and, together with him, bless, we beseech thee, our
gracious Queen _Mary_, _Alexandra_ the Queen Mother, _Edward_ Prince
of Wales, and all the Royal Family; that they, ever trusting in thy
goodness, protected by thy power, and crowned with thy gracious and
endless favour, may long continue before thee in peace and safety,
joy and honour, and after death may obtain everlasting life and
glory; by the merits and mediation of Christ Jesus our Saviour,
who with thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth ever one
God, world without end. _Amen_.

Almighty God, who rulest over all the kingdoms of the world, and
dost order them according to thy good pleasure; We yield thee
unfeigned thanks, for that thou wast pleased, _as on this day_,
to set thy Servant our Sovereign Lord, King _GEORGE_, upon the
throne of this Realm. Let thy wisdom be his guide, and let thine arm
strengthen him; let truth and justice, holiness and righteousness,
peace and charity abound in his days. Direct all his counsels and
endeavours to thy glory, and the welfare of his subjects; give us
grace to obey him cheerfully for conscience sake, and let him
always possess the hearts of his people; let his reign be long
and prosperous, and crown him with everlasting life in the world

O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only Saviour, the
Prince of Peace; Give us grace seriously to lay to heart the great
dangers we are in by our unhappy divisions. Take away all hatred
and prejudice, and whatsoever else may hinder us from godly union
and concord: that, as there is but one Body, and one Spirit, and
one hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God
and Father of us all, so we may henceforth be all of one heart,
and of one soul, united in one holy bond of truth and peace, of
faith and charity, and may with one mind and one mouth glorify
thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

O God, who providest for thy people by thy power, and rulest
over them in love; Vouchsafe so to bless thy Servant our King,
that under him this nation may be wisely governed, and thy Church
may serve thee in all godly quietness; and grant that he being
devoted to thee with his whole heart, and persevering in good
works unto the end, may, by thy guidance, come to thine everlasting
kingdom; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who liveth and
reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without

THE EPISTLE. 1 St Peter ii. 11.

Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your
conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak
against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which
they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submit
yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether
it be to the King, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that
are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise
of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that with well
doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as free,
and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as
the servants of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear
God. Honour the King.

THE GOSPEL. St Matth. xxii. 16.

And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way
of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
regardest not the person of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest
thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus
perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye
hypocrites? Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto
him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
superscription? They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto
them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's;
and unto God the things that are God's. When they had heard these
words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.

_If this day should fall on a Sunday or other holy day, the
Collect, Epistle, and Gospel of the day shall be used, and the
Collect_, O God, who providest, _shall be said after the Collect
of the day_.

III.

_The following Service may also be used on the same day at any
convenient time_.

TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.

We praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.

All the earth doth worship thee: the Father everlasting.

To thee all Angels cry aloud: the Heavens, and all the Powers
therein.

To thee Cherubin, and Seraphin: continually do cry,

Holy, Holy, Holy: Lord God of Sabaoth;

Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty: of thy Glory.

The glorious company of the Apostles: praise thee.

The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: praise thee.

The noble army of Martyrs: praise thee.

The holy Church throughout all the world: doth acknowledge thee;

The Father: of an infinite Majesty;

Thine honourable, true: and only Son;

Also the Holy Ghost: the Comforter.

Thou art the King of Glory: O Christ.

Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father.

When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou didst not abhor
the Virgin's womb.

When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death: thou didst open
the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.

Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the Glory of the Father.

We believe that thou shalt come: to be our Judge.

We therefore pray thee, help thy servants: whom thou hast redeemed
with thy precious blood.

Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting.

O Lord, save thy people: and bless thine heritage.

Govern them: and lift them up for ever.

Day by day: we magnify thee;

And we worship thy Name: ever world without end.

Vouchsafe, O Lord: to keep us this day without sin.

O Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us.

O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us: as our trust is in thee.

O Lord, in thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded.

_Then the Priest shall say_,

The Lord be with you.

_Answer_. And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

_Christ, have mercy upon us_.

Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation;
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

_Then the Priest standing up shall say_,

O Lord, save the King;

_Answer_. Who putteth his trust in thee.

_Priest_. Send him help from thy holy place.

_Answer_. And evermore mightily defend him.

_Priest_. Let his enemies have no advantage of him.

_Answer_. Nor the wicked approach to hurt him.

_Priest_. O Lord, hear our prayer.

_Answer_. And let our cry come unto thee.

Let us pray.

O God, who providest for thy people by thy power, and rulest over
them in love; Vouchsafe so to bless thy Servant our King, that
under him this nation may be wisely governed, and thy Church may
serve thee in all godly quietness; and grant that he being devoted
to thee with his whole heart, and persevering in good works unto
the end, may, by thy guidance, come to thine everlasting kingdom;
through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with
thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. _Amen_.

O Lord our God, who upholdest and governest all things by the word
of thy power; Receive our humble prayers for our Sovereign Lord
_GEORGE_, _as on this day_ set over us by thy grace and providence
to be our King; and, together with him, bless, we beseech thee,
our gracious Queen _Mary_, _Alexandra_ the Queen Mother, _Edward_
Prince of Wales, and all the Royal Family; that they, ever trusting
in thy goodness, protected by thy power, and crowned with thy
gracious and endless favour, may long continue before thee in
peace and safety, joy and honour, and after death may obtain
everlasting life and glory; by the merits and mediation of Christ
Jesus our Saviour, who with thee and the Holy Ghost liveth and
reigneth ever one God, world without end. _Amen_.

Almighty God, who rulest over all the kingdoms of the world, and
dost order them according to thy good pleasure; We yield thee
unfeigned thanks, for that thou wast pleased, _as on this day_,
to set thy Servant our Sovereign Lord, King _GEORGE_, upon the
throne of this Realm. Let thy wisdom be his guide, and let thine arm
strengthen him; let truth and justice, holiness and righteousness,
peace and charity abound in his days. Direct all his counsels and
endeavours to thy glory, and the welfare of his subjects; give us
grace to obey him cheerfully for conscience sake, and let him
always possess the hearts of his people; let his reign be long and
prosperous, and crown him with everlasting life in the world to
come; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

_A Prayer for Unity_.

O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only Saviour, the
Prince of Peace; Give us grace seriously to lay to heart the great
dangers we are in by our unhappy divisions. Take away all hatred
and prejudice, and whatsoever else may hinder us from godly union
and concord: that, as there is but one Body, and one Spirit, and
one hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God
and Father of us all, so we may henceforth be all of one heart, and
of one soul, united in one holy bond of truth and peace, of faith
and charity, and may with one mind and one mouth glorify thee;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, who knowest our
necessities before we ask, and our ignorance in asking; We beseech
thee to have compassion upon our infirmities; and those things,
which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our blindness we
cannot ask, vouch safe to give us for the worthiness of thy Son
Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen_.

The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you always. _Amen_.

I. _Of Faith in the Holy Trinity_.

There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body,
parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the
Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And
in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance,
power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

II. _Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man_.

The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting
of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with
the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin,
of her substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is
to say, the Godhead and manhood, were joined together in one
Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God,
and very man; who truly suffered, was crucified, dead and buried,
to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only
for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.

III. _Of the going down of Christ into Hell_.

As Christ died for us, and was buried: so also is it to be
believed, that he went down into Hell.

IV. _Of the Resurrection of Christ_.

Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body,
with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection
of man's nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there
sitteth, until he return to judge all men at the last day.

V. _Of the Holy Ghost_.

The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one
substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very
and eternal God.

VI. _Of the Sufficiency of the holy Scriptures for salvation_.

Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not
to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article
of the faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.
In the name of the holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical
Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never
any doubt in the Church.

_Of the Names and Number of the Canonical Books_.

Genesis,                        The First Book of Chronicles,
Exodus,                         The Second Book of Chronicles,
Leviticus,                      The First Book of Esdras,
Numbers,                        The Second Book of Esdras,
Deuteronomy,                    The Book of Esther,
Joshua,                         The Book of Job,
Judges,                         The Psalms,
Ruth,                           The Proverbs,
The First Book of Samuel,       Ecclesiastes or Preacher,
The Second Book of Samuel,      Cantica, or Songs of Solomon,
The First Book of Kings,        Four Prophets the greater,
The Second Book of Kings,       Twelve Prophets the less.

And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for
example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not
apply them to establish any doctrine; such are these following;

The Third Book of Esdras,       Baruch the Prophet,
The Fourth Book of Esdras,      The Song of the Three Children,
The Book of Tobias,             The Story of Susanna,
The Book of Judith,             Of Bel and the Dragon,
The rest of the Book of Esther, The Prayer of Manasses,
The Book of Wisdom,             The First Book of Maccabees,
Jesus the Son of Sirach,        The Second Book of Maccabees.

All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received,
we do receive, and account them Canonical.

VII. _Of the Old Testament_.

The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old
and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ,
who is the only Mediator between God and man, being both God and
man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old
Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the Law
given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not
bind Christian men, nor the civil precepts thereof ought of
necessity to be received in any Commonwealth; yet notwithstanding,
no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the
Commandments which are called Moral.

VIII. _Of the Three Creeds_.

The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that
which is commonly called the Apostles Creed, ought thoroughly
to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain
warrants of holy Scripture.

IX. _Of Original or Birth-sin_.

Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the
Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the
Nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring
of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness,
and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh
lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every
person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and
damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in
them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called
in the Greek, _phronema sarkos_, which some do expound the wisdom,
some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the
flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is
no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the
Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself
the nature of sin.

X. _Of Free-Will_.

The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot
turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good
works, to faith, and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power
to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace
of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and
working with us, when we have that good will.

XI. _Of the Justification of Man_.

We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own
works or deservings: Wherefore, that we are justified by faith only
is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more
largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.

XII. _Of Good Works_.

Albeit that good works, which are the fruits of faith, and follow
after Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the
severity of God's Judgement; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to
God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively
faith; insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently
known as a tree discerned by the fruit.

XIII. _Of Works before Justification_.

Works done before the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his
Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of
faith in Jesu Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive
grace, or (as the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity:
yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and
commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature
of sin.

XIV. _Of Works of Supererogation_.

Voluntary works besides, over and above, God's Commandments,
which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without
arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not
only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they
do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas
Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to
you, say, We be unprofitable servants.

XV. _Of Christ alone without Sin_.

Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all
things, sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in
his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot,
who, by sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the sins
of the world, and sin, as Saint John saith, was not in him. But all
we the rest, although baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend
in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.

XVI. _Of Sin after Baptism_.

Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin
against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant
of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after
Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from
grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise
again, and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned,
which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny
the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.

XVII. _Of Predestination and Election_.

Predestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God,
whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath
constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from
curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of
mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as
vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be endued with so
excellent a benefit of God be called according to God's purpose by
his Spirit working in due season: they through grace obey the
calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by
adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son
Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length,
by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.

As the godly consideration of predestination, and our election in
Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly
persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit
of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly
members, and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as
well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of
eternal salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth
fervently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal
persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before
their eyes the sentence of God's predestination, is a most
dangerous downfal, whereby the devil doth thrust them either into
desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no
less perilous than desperation.

Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they
be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture: and, in our
doings, that will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly
declared unto us in the Word of God.

XVIII. _Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ_.

They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every
man shall be saved by the law or sect which he professeth, so that
he be diligent to frame his life according to that law, and the
light of nature. For holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the
Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.

XIX. _Of the Church_.

The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in
the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be
duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things
that of necessity are requisite to the same.

As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred;
so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and
manner of ceremonies, but also in matters of faith.

XX. _Of the Authority of the Church_.

The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority
in controversies of faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church
to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither
may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to
another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper
of holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the
same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to be
believed for necessity of salvation.

XXI. _Of the Authority of General Councils_.

General Councils may not be gathered together without the
commandment and will of Princes. And when they be gathered
together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be
not governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and
sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore
things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither
strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be
taken out of holy Scripture.

XXII. _Of Purgatory_.

The Romish doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping
and Adoration, as well of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation
of Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no
warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.

XXIII. _Of Ministering in the Congregation_.

It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public
preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation,
before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And
those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen
and called to this work by men who have public authority given unto
them in the Congregation, to call and send Ministers into the Lord's
vineyard.

XXIV. _Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the
people understandeth_.

It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom
of the Primitive Church, to have public Prayer in the Church, or to
minister the Sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.

XXV. _Of the Sacraments_.

Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of
Christian men's profession, but rather they be certain sure
witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God's goodwill
towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth
not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our faith in him.

There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel,
that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.

Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,
Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be
counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown
partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states
of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of
Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have
not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.

The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to
be carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such
only as worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or
operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase to
themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.

XXVI. _Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not
the effect of the Sacrament_.

Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with
the good, and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the
ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do
not the same in their own name, but in Christ's, and do minister
by his commission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both
in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of the Sacraments.
Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their
wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as
by faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto
them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and
promise, although they be ministered by evil men.

Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church,
that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused
by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally being
found guilty, by just judgement, be deposed.

XXVII. _Of Baptism_.

Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference,
whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not
christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or new birth,
whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly
are grafted into the Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin,
and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are
visibly signed and sealed; faith is confirmed, and grace increased
by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young children is in
any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with the
institution of Christ.

XXVIII. _Of the Lord's Supper_.

The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that
Christians ought to have among themselves one to another; but
rather is a Sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death:
insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith,
receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the
Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking
of the Blood of Christ.

Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of bread and
wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ; but
is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the
nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.

The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only
after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the
Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is faith.

The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance
reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.

XXIX. _Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ in the use
of the Lord's Supper_.

The wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do
carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine
saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise
are they partakers of Christ: but rather to their condemnation do
eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.

XXX. _Of both kinds_.

The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for
both the parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and
commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.

XXXI. _Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross_.

The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption,
propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world,
both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for
sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the
which it was commonly said, that the Priests did offer Christ for
the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were
blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.

XXXII. _Of the Marriage of Priests_.

Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law,
either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from
marriage. Therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other
Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall
judge the same to serve better to godliness.

XXXIII. _Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided_.

That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly
cut off from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought
to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen
and Publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance, and
received into the Church by a judge that hath authority thereunto.

XXXIV. _Of the Traditions of the Church_.

It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places
one, and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and
may be changed according to the diversities of countries, times,
and men's manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word.
Whosoever through his private judgement, willingly and purposely,
doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church,
which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and
approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that
others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the
common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the
Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak brethren.

Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain,
change, and abolish, Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained
only by man's authority, so that all things be done to edifying.

XXXV. _Of the Homilies_.

The second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have
joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome
doctrine, and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of
Homilies, which were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth;
and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the
Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be understanded
of the people.

_Of the Names of the Homilies_.

1 Of the right Use of the Church. 10 Of the reverend estimation of
2 Against peril of Idolatry.          God's Word.
3 Of repairing and keeping clean  11 Of Alms-doing.
   of Churches.                   12 Of the Nativity of Christ.
4 Of good works: first of         13 Of the Passion of Christ.
   Fasting.                       14 Of the Resurrection of Christ.
5 Against gluttony and            15 Of the worthy receiving of the
   drunkenness.                       Sacrament of the Body and
6 Against excess of apparel.          Blood of Christ.
7 Of Prayer.                      16 Of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost.
8 Of the place and time of        17 For the Rogation-days.
   Prayer.                        18 Of the State of Matrimony.
9 That Common Prayers and         19 Of Repentance.
   Sacraments ought to be         20 Against idleness,
   ministered in a known tongue.  21 Against rebellion.

XXXVI. _Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers_.

The Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering
of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the
Sixth, and confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament,
doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering:
neither hath it any thing, that of itself is superstitious and
ungodly. And therefore whosoever are consecrated or ordered
according to the Rites of that Book, since the second year of
the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter shall be
consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites, we decree all
such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.

XXXVII. _Of the Civil Magistrates_.

The King's Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England,
and other his Dominions, unto whom the chief government of all
Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in
all causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to
any foreign jurisdiction.

Where we attribute to the King's Majesty the chief government,
by which titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to
be offended; we give not to our Princes the ministering either of
God's Word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions
also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly
testify; but that only prerogative, which we see to have been
given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God
himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees
committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical
or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and
evildoers.

The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.

The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for
heinous and grievous offences.

It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate,
to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.

XXXVIII. _Of Christian men's Goods, which are not common_.

The riches and goods of Christians are not common, as touching
the right, title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists
do falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things
as he possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to
his ability.

XXXIX. _Of a Christian man's Oath_.

As we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian
men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge
that Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may
swear when the Magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and
charity, so it be done according to the Prophet's teaching, in
justice, judgement, and truth.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
