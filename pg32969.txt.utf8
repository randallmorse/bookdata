PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION


It cannot be urged against this work that it travels along a path
already well worn, for the subject of trees and shrubs for English
gardens, though almost inexhaustible, has never been so fully treated
and illustrated as it deserves. The book may have many defects, but its
pages will show that an honest effort has been made to offer helpful and
instructive information to the many who wish to know more of the beauty
of trees and shrubs.

In writing this book, the labour of my spare hours for many months, I
have been greatly helped by Mr. Bean, the assistant-curator of the Royal
Gardens, Kew, whose deep knowledge of the subject has been willingly
imparted; and by Miss Jekyll, to whom I am indebted for many valuable
suggestions and notes. Among others to whom grateful thanks are tendered
are Mrs. Davidson, Mr. J. Clark, Mr. Dallimore, and Mr. S. W.
Fitzherbert.

Some of the chapters have already appeared in the _Garden_, with the
object of making known as widely as possible the importance of the most
beautiful trees and shrubs for English woodland and pleasure-grounds.

The illustrations will show how a shrub, so often stunted and mutilated
by unwise pruning, becomes beautiful when allowed to develop naturally.

The illustrations have their own teaching value, and in this matter
also I desire to thank many willing helpers, especially Miss Jekyll,
Miss Willmott, and Mr. Crump, of the Madresfield Court Gardens. Many of
them are from photographs taken in the Royal Gardens, Kew. Under the
present director (Sir William Thiselton-Dyer) much has been done in the
judicious grouping of plants. Here is a living place of instruction open
to all.

Those who desire to know more about trees and shrubs than it is possible
to give in this book should consult such famous works as Loudon's
"Arboretum Britannicum" (8 vols.), and "Encyclopædia of Trees and
Shrubs"; Professor Sargent's "Silva of North America," and "Forest Flora
of Japan"; "Manual of Coniferæ," by Messrs. James Veitch & Sons; "The
Pinetum," by George Gordon; The "Bamboo Garden," by Lord Redesdale; Sir
Joseph Hooker's "Rhododendrons of the Sikkim Himalaya"; and the
excellent Kew Hand-list of Trees and Shrubs. Much information can also
be gleaned from the volumes of _Garden and Forest_ (American), edited
by Professor Sargent, but not now in publication.

The nomenclature at Kew--that is, according to the _Index Kewensis_--is
that adopted in this book.

It is the wish and hope of the author, whose notes, taken during many
years, are embodied, that the book may do something to make English
gardens more beautiful and interesting, and that it may win many to see
the better ways of planting; also that it may be the means of bringing
forward the many trees and shrubs of rare charm that are generally
unknown or unheeded.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION


This edition has been thoroughly revised to render it as useful as
possible to those who desire a larger acquaintance with the many
beautiful trees and shrubs that are hardy in this country. I must tender
my heartiest thanks to Mr. William Atkinson (Messrs. Fisher, Son, &
Sibray) for his valuable help in preparing this edition. Many of the
illustrations represent trees and shrubs in the Royal Gardens, Kew,
which are not only beautiful in themselves, but are the centre of
scientific research.

CHAPTER I

WANT OF VARIETY A BLEMISH


There is a sad want of variety amongst evergreen and deciduous shrubs in
the average English garden. Faith is placed in a few shrubs with a
reputation for robbing the soil of its goodness and making a monotonous
ugly green bank, neither pleasant to look at nor of any protective
value. As one who knows shrubs well and the way to group them says,
"Even the landscape gardeners, the men who have the making of
gardens--with, of course, notable exceptions--do not seem to know the
rich storehouse to draw from." Very true is this. We see evidence of it
every day. The mixed shrubbery is fondly clung to as a place for all
shrubs, whether flowering or otherwise, and the result is a thicket of
growths, a case indeed of a survival of the fittest. There are other
shrubs than Privet in this fair world of ours, and as for providing
shelter, the wind whistles through its bare stems and creates a draught
good for neither man, beast, nor plant. Of the cherry laurel again there
is far too much in gardens. Few other plants can stand against its
greedy, searching roots, and its vigorous branches and big leaves kill
other leaf-growth near them. Grown in the proper way, that is, as an
isolated shrub, with abundance of space to develop its graceful branches
and brilliant green leaves, the Cherry Laurel is a beautiful evergreen;
it is quite happy in shady, half-wooded places. But grown, as it is so
often, jammed up and smothering other things, or held in bounds by a
merciless and beauty-destroying knife, its presence has not been to the
advantage of English gardening.

When the planting season comes round, think of some of the good shrubs
not yet in the garden, and forget pontic Rhododendron, Laurel, Aucuba,
and Privet. By this is not meant rare shrubs, such as may only be had
from the few nurseries of the very highest rank or from those that make
rare shrubs a speciality, but good things that may be grown in any
garden and that appear in all good shrub catalogues.

[Illustration: _CHINESE GUELDER ROSE._]

Perhaps no beautiful and now well-known shrub is more neglected than
beautiful _Exochorda grandiflora_ (the Pearl Bush). Its near relatives,
the Spiræas, are in every shrubbery, but one may go through twenty and
not see Exochorda. Even of the Spiræas one does not half often see
enough of _S. Thunbergi_, a perfect milky way of little starry bloom in
April and a most shapely little bush, or the double-flowered _S.
prunifolia_, with its long wreaths of flower-like double thorn or minute
white roses and its autumn bravery of scarlet foliage. The hardy
Magnolias are not given the opportunity they deserve of making our
gardens lovely in earliest summer. Who that has seen _Magnolia stellata_
in its April dress of profuse white bloom and its summer and autumn
dignity of handsome though not large foliage, would endure to be without
it? or who would not desire to have the fragrant chalices of _M.
soulangeana_, with their outside staining of purple, and _M. conspicua_,
of purest white in the early months of March and April? And why does not
every garden hold one, at least, of the sweet _Chimonanthus_, offering,
as it does in February, an abundance of its little blooms of a fragrance
so rich and powerful that it can be scarcely matched throughout the
year?

[Illustration: _A GROUPING OF MAGNOLIA STELLATA._]

_Cassinia fulvida_, still known in nurseries by its older name of
Diplopappus, in winter wears its fullest dress of tiny gold-backed
leafage in long graceful sprays, that are borne in such profusion that
they only beg to be cut to accompany the rare flowers of winter that we
bring indoors to sweeten and enliven our rooms.

Of small-flowering trees none is lovelier than the Snowy Mespilus
(_Amelanchier_), and for a tree of somewhat larger size the good garden
form of the native Bird Cherry is beautiful in the early year. The North
American _Halesia_ (the Snowdrop Tree) should be in every garden, either
as a bush or tree, every branch hung in May with its full array of
pendent bloom of the size and general shape of Snowdrops, only of a warm
and almost creamy instead of a cold snow-white colour.

Few spring-flowering shrubs are more free and graceful than _Forsythia
suspensa_, and if it can be planted on a slight eminence and encouraged
to throw down its many-feet-long graceful sprays it then exhibits its
best garden use. The Chinese _Viburnum plicatum_ is another shrub well
known but unfairly neglected, flowering with the earliest Irises.
Grouped with the grand _Iris pallida dalmatica_ it is a thing never to
be forgotten.

[Illustration: _ÆSCULUS PARVIFLORA (late July)._]

_Æsculus (Pavia) parviflora_, blooming in July when flowering shrubs are
rare, is easily grown and strikingly handsome, and yet how rarely seen!
_Calycanthus floridus_, with its spice-scented blooms of low-toned
crimson, also a late summer flower, is a fine thing in a cool,
well-sheltered corner, where the sun cannot burn the flowers. The Rose
Acacia (_Robinia hispida_), trained on a wall or house, is as beautiful
as any Wistaria, and the quality of the low-toned rosy bloom of a much
rarer colour. It is quite hardy, but so brittle that it needs close and
careful wall training or other support. To name a few others in the same
kind of category, but rather less hardy, the Sweet Bay is the noblest of
evergreen bushes or small trees; the Tamarisk, with its grey plumes of
foliage and summer flower-plumes of tenderest pink, is a delightful
plant in our southern counties, doing especially well near the sea.
_Clethra alnifolia_, against a wall or in the open, is a mass of flower
in late summer, and the best of the _Hibiscus syriacus_, or _Althæa
frutex_, the shrubbery representatives of Mallows and Hollyhocks, are
autumn flowers of the best class. A bushy plant of half-woody
character that may well be classed among shrubs, and that was beloved of
our grandmothers, is _Leycesteria formosa_, a delightful thing in the
later autumn. The large-fruited Euonymus (Spindle Tree) is another good
thing too little grown.

[Illustration: _DOUBLE-FLOWERED SLOE OR BLACKTHORN._]

For a peaty garden there are many delightful plants in the neglected
though easy-to-be-had list. One of these is the beautiful and highly
fragrant _Azalea occidentalis_, all the better that the flowers and
leaves come together and that it is later than the Ghent Azaleas. Then
there are the two sweet-scented North American Bog Myrtles, _Myrica
cerifera_ and _Comptonia asplenifolia_, the charming little _Leiophyllum
buxifolium_, of neatest bushy form, and the _Ledum palustre_, whose
bruised leaves are of delightful aromatic fragrance; _Vaccinium
pennsylvanicum_, pretty in leaf and flower and blazing scarlet in
autumn, and _Gaultheria Shallon_, a most important sub-shrub, revelling
in moist peat or any cool sandy soil.

These examples by no means exhaust the list of desirable shrubs that may
be found for the slightest seeking. This brief recital of their names
and qualities is only meant as a reminder that all these good things are
close at hand, while many more are only waiting to be asked for.




CHAPTER II

ORNAMENTAL PLANTING IN WOODLAND


Where woodland adjoins garden ground, and the one passes into the other
by an almost imperceptible gradation, a desire is often felt to let the
garden influence penetrate some way into the wood by the planting within
the wood of some shrubs or trees of distinctly ornamental character.

Such a desire very naturally arises--it is wild gardening with the
things of larger growth; but, like all forms of wild gardening (which of
all branches of gardening is the most difficult to do rightly, and needs
the greatest amount of knowledge), the wishes of the planter must be
tempered with extreme precaution and restraint. It does not do to plant
in the wild garden things of well-known garden character. This is merely
to spoil the wood, which, in many cases, is already so good that any
addition would be a tasteless intrusion of something irrelevant and
unsuitable.

[Illustration: _IN THE WOODLAND AT KEW, SHOWING TREE AND SHRUB BY GRASSY
WAY._]

Still, there are certain wooded places where a judicious planting would
be a gain, and there are a certain number of trees and shrubs which
those who have a fair knowledge of their ways, and a true sympathy with
the nature of woodland, recognise as suitable for this kind of planting.
They will be found in these classes: Native growths that are absent
or unusual in the district, such as the Spindle Tree (_Euonymus_), White
Beam, Service Tree, White and Black Thorn, Wild Cherry, Bird Cherry,
Wild Guelder Rose (_Viburnum Opulus_), and _V. Lantana_, Honeysuckle,
Wild Roses, Juniper, and _Daphne Laureola_.

[Illustration: _WAYFARING TREE (Viburnum Lantana); A NATIVE SHRUB ON
CHALK._]

Then, among cultivated trees and shrubs, those that are nearly related
to our wild kinds, including some that are found in foreign woodlands
that have about the same latitude and climate as our own. Among these
will be Quinces and Medlars, many kinds of ornamental Cratægus, Scarlet
Oaks, various Elders and Crabs, and the grand _Pyrus americana_, so like
our native Mountain Ash, but on a much larger scale.

A very careful planting with trees and shrubs of some of these and,
perhaps, other allied kinds, may give additional beauty and interest to
woodland. Differences of soil will, of course, be carefully considered,
for if a piece of woodland were on chalky soil, a totally different
selection should be made from one that would be right for a soil that
was poor and sandy.

In moist, sandy, or, still better, peaty ground, especially where there
is a growth of Birches and Scotch Firs, and not many other kinds of
trees, a plantation of Rhododendrons may have a fine effect. But in this
case it is better to use the common _R. ponticum_ only, as a mixture of
differently coloured kinds is sure to give a misplaced-garden look, or
an impression as if a bit of garden ground had missed its way and got
lost in the wood.




CHAPTER III

GROUPING OF TREES AND SHRUBS


If this subject were considered with only a reasonable amount of
thought, and the practice of it controlled by good taste, there is
nothing that would do more for the beauty of our gardens or grounds.
Nothing can so effectually destroy good effect as the usual senseless
mixture of deciduous and evergreen shrubs that, alas! is so commonly
seen in gardens--a mixture of one each of a quantity of perhaps
excellent things planted about three feet apart. There would be nothing
to be said against this if it were the deliberate intention of any
individual, for, as a garden is for the owner's happiness, it is
indisputably his right to take his pleasure in it as he will, and if he
says, "I have only space for a hundred plants, and I wish them to be all
different," that is for him to decide. But when the mixture is made from
pure ignorance or helplessness it is then that advice may be of use, and
that the assurance may be given that there are better ways that are just
as easy at the beginning, and that with every year will be growing on
towards some definite scheme of beauty, instead of merely growing up
into a foolish tangle of horticultural imbecility.

If the intending planter has no knowledge it is well worth his while to
take advice at the beginning, not to plant at random and to feel, a few
years later, first doubt, and then regret, and then, as knowledge grows,
to have to face the fact that it is all wrong and that much precious
time has been lost.

How to group is a large question, depending on all the conditions of the
place under consideration. Whether a group is to be of tall or short
growing shrubs or trees, whether it is to be of three or three hundred,
and so on. The knowledge that can answer is the knowledge of gardening
of the better kind. The whole thing should be done carefully on paper
beforehand, or there will again be repented the error of huddled single
plants. The groups will have to be well shaped and well sized and well
related to each other and all that is near, or they may be merely a
series of senseless blocks, not intelligently formed groups at all.

Then, in proper relation to the groups, single plants can be used with
the best possible effect, as, for instance, a snowy Mespilus or a Cherry
or a _Pyrus floribunda_ against a dark massing of Yew or Holly; or a
_Forsythia suspensa_ casting out its long flowering branches from among
bushes of _Berberis_. Then the fewer individuals will have their full
value, while the larger masses will have dignity even when in leaf only,
and their own special beauty at the time when they are in flower or
fruit. For some flowering and fruiting bushes are best grouped, while a
few are best seen standing alone, and it is only knowledge of good
gardening that can guide the designer in his decisions on these points.
Still it does not follow that a shrub or flowering tree cannot be used
both for groups and single use, for such an one as the Forsythia just
mentioned is also of charming effect in its own groups, with the
red-tinted _Berberis_ or the quiet-coloured Savins, or whatever be the
lower growing bushy mass that is chosen to accompany it. Every one can
see the great gain of such arrangements when they are made, but to learn
to make them, and even to perceive what are the plants to group
together, and why, that is the outcome of the education of the garden
artist.

In the Royal Gardens, Kew, the best of plants may be seen and, to a
considerable degree, the best ways of using them in gardens.

[Illustration: _GROUPING OF SHRUB AND DAFFODIL._]

The one-thing-at-a-time planting is always a safe guide, but as the
planter gains a firmer grasp of his subject, so he may exercise more
freedom in its application. Nearly every garden, shrubbery, and
ornamental tree plantation is spoilt or greatly marred by too great a
mixture of incongruous growths. Nothing wants more careful
consideration. On the ground in the open air, and sitting at home
quietly thinking, the question should be carefully thought out. The very
worst thing to do is to take a nursery catalogue and make out from it a
list of supposed wants. The right thing is to make a plan of the ground,
to scale, if possible, though a rougher one may serve, and mark it all
down in good time beforehand, not to wait until the last moment and then
mark it; and not to send the list to the nursery till the ground is
well forward for planting, so that the moment the plants come they may
go to their places.

[Illustration: _NATURAL GROUPING OF SHRUB IN ROUGH GROUND._]

All this planning and thinking should be done in the summer, so that the
list may go to the nursery in September, which will enable the
nurseryman to supply the trees in the earliest and best of the planting
season.

How good it would be to plant a whole hill-side on chalky soil with
grand groupings of Yew or Box, or with these intergrouped, and how easy
afterwards to run among these groupings of lesser shrubs; or to plant
light land with Scotch Fir and Holly, Thorn and Juniper (just these few
things grouped and intergrouped); or wastes of sandhills near the sea
within our milder shores with Sea Buckthorn and Tamarisk, and Monterey
Cypress (_Cupressus macrocarpa_), and long drifts of the handsome Blue
Lyme Grass.

A mile of sandy littoral might be transformed with these few things, and
no others than its own wild growths, into a region of delight, where
noble tree form of rapid growth, tender colour of plume-like branch and
bloom and brilliant berry, and waving blue grassy ribbons, equalling in
value any of the lesser Bamboos, would show a lesson of simple planting
such as is most to be desired but is rarely to be seen.

The other and commoner way is nothing but a muddle from beginning to
end. A van-load of shrubs arrives from the nursery--one of each or
perhaps not more than six of any kind. No plan is prepared, and the
trees and shrubs are planted in the usual weary mixture, without thought
or design. Generally there are three times too many for the space. It is
a cruel waste and misuse of good things.




CHAPTER IV

HEATHY PATHS IN OUTER GARDEN SPACES


The subject of heathy paths comes within the scope of this book. We are
not thinking of grass or gravel paths, but those in pleasure-grounds
that are beyond the province of the trimly-kept garden, and yet have to
be somewhat tamed from the mere narrow track such as serves for the
gamekeeper on his rounds. Paths of this kind admit of varied treatment.
The nature of the place and the requirements of those who use the paths
will determine their general nature, and settle whether they are to be
of turf or of something that must be dry in all weathers. But grass and
gravel are not the only alternatives. One kind of path not often seen,
but always pleasant, and at one time of year distinctly beautiful, can
be made of the Common Heather (_Calluna vulgaris_). We know of such a
path, 12 feet wide and some hundreds of feet long, carpeted with this
native Heath, mown once a year, and feeling like a thick pile carpet to
the feet; grey-green in summer, bronze-coloured in late autumn, and in
the second and third weeks of August thickly set with short sprays of
the low-toned pink of the Heather bloom. It is not so dry as a gravel
path, but a good deal drier than grass, and has a pleasant feeling of
elasticity that is absent in common turf.

Many are the pleasure-grounds in the south of England and Scotland where
the soil is sandy and, perhaps, peaty. Any such can have these pleasant
heathy paths. We have even seen them on a poor sandy clay, scarcely good
enough to call loam, in Sussex; for Calluna, unlike the other Heaths,
will grow willingly in clay. In the case quoted the plant was wild in
the place.

In a Fir wood, the bare earth carpeted with needles always makes a
suitable path, and one that is always dry; the only thing to correct is
to fill up any places where the bare roots rise above the path level.
For in these informal paths, where we want to look about and at the
trees, there should be no danger of being tripped up. The path, of
whatever nature, should be wide enough for two persons--5 feet to 6 feet
is ample; but it should have quite a different character from the garden
path, in that its edges are not defined or straightened.

[Illustration: _SHRUB AND IRIS GROUPS BY WOODLAND._]

One may often see in the outskirts of an old garden a dense wood that
once was only a growth of shrubbery size. The walk was originally
bordered by a Box edging, and there may have been a strip of flowers
between it and the shrubs. Here and there one may still see a yard or
two of straggling Box nearly 2 feet high. Of course, this edging should
have been removed as soon as the place became a wood, for after a
certain time its original use as a formal edging to a trim plantation
ceased to exist.

Nothing is pleasanter in woodland than broad, grassy ways, well enough
levelled to insure safety to an unheeding walker. In early spring,
before the grass has grown any height, here is the place where Daffodils
can best be seen and enjoyed, some in the clear grass and some running
back in wide drifts into any side opening of the wood. If the grass is
cut in June, when the Daffodil foliage is ripe, and again early in
September, these two mowings will suffice for the year.

[Illustration: _AZALEA GARDEN AT KEW (early Summer)._]

In many woody places where shade is fairly thick, if there is any grass
it will probably be full of moss. No path-carpet is more beautiful than
a mossy one; indeed, where grass walks from the garden pass into
woodland, the mossy character so sympathetic to the wood should be
treasured, and the moss should not be scratched out with iron rakes.
Often in the lawn proper a mixture of moss and grass is desirable,
though one has been taught that all moss is hateful. In such places,
though it may be well to check it by raking out every four or five
years, it should by no means be destroyed, for in the lawn spaces
adjoining trees or woodland the moss is right and harmonious.

There are paths for the garden and paths for the wood. A mistaken zeal
that would insist on the trimness of the straight-edged garden walk in
woodland or wild is just as much misplaced as if by slothful oversight
an accumulation of dead leaves or other débris of natural decay were
permitted to remain in the region of formal terrace or parterre.

Heath paths should be made by either planting or sowing. The common ling
(_Calluna vulgaris_) makes the best turf. If the ground is sown it
should be of nearly pure sandy peat, or weeds would be troublesome. If
the path is to be made by planting, it should be done with two-year-old
seedlings--nothing larger--planted about 6 inches apart. The path when
grown should be mown with a machine once a year, in autumn after the
blooming time of the heath. There must be no grass.




CHAPTER V

TREES AND SHRUBS IN POOR SOILS


As there is vegetation to suit nearly all natural conditions, so those
who find they have to undertake planting in poor, dry, hungry sands and
gravels will find that there are plenty of trees and shrubs that can be
used, though the choice is necessarily a more restricted one than they
might make on better land. The very fact of the fewer number of
available trees and shrubs may even be a benefit in disguise, as by
obliging the planter to be more restricted in his choice the planting
scheme will be all the more harmonious.

As to trees, Holly, Thorn, Juniper, Birch, Scotch Fir, and Mountain Ash
are found wild on the poorest soils, and will even grow in almost pure
sand. Oaks, though they never grow to the dimensions of the Oak of loamy
woodlands, are abundant on poor soils, where they have a character of
their own that is full of pictorial value. The lovely _Amelanchier_,
daintiest of small trees, revels in sandy woods, as does also the Bird
Cherry, another good native tree, while the Wild Cherry becomes a forest
tree of large size and of loveliest bloom. Evergreen or _Holm Oak_ and
_Arbutus_ are excellent in the south of England, enjoying the warmth and
winter dryness of light soils.

Garden shrubs in general can be grown, though not so luxuriantly as on
better soils, but some classes are especially successful on poor land
such as _Genista virgata_. There are the Cistuses and Heaths, with
Lavender and Rosemary, in the drier parts, and in the wetter places
_Kalmias_, _Andromedas_, _Rhododendrons_, _Ledums_, _Pernettyas_, and
_Vacciniums_, with the Candleberry Gale and the native Bog Myrtle, also
Broom and Gorse, especially the Double Gorse. These, which are usually
classed as peat shrubs, will succeed in any sandy soil with the addition
of leaf-mould, and are among the most interesting and beautiful of our
garden shrubs.

Those who garden on poor and dry soils should remember that though their
ground has drawbacks it has also some compensations. Such soils do not
dry in cracks and open fissures in hot weather, and do not present a
surface of soapy slides in wet; they can be worked at all times of the
year, except in hard frost; they are easy to hoe and keep clean of weeds
and are pleasant and easy to work. They correct the tendency of strong
soils to the making of a quantity of coarse rank growth, and they
encourage the production of a quantity of flowers of good colour.




CHAPTER VI

PRUNING FLOWERING TREES AND SHRUBS


The art of pruning properly is one that is acquired by considerable
practice and observation. The first is necessary that the actual work
may be well and cleanly done, and it is only by observing the manner and
times of flowering of the different trees and shrubs which go to
constitute a well-kept pleasure-ground that the proper time to prune can
be thoroughly understood. The manner of pruning varies considerably,
some pinning their faith to a slanting cut towards a bud; some
preferring a straight cut; while others again are content with simply
slashing off the useless wood in the quickest possible manner. The
former is the best method, as it does not present a surface for the
lodgment of water, an important point with those shrubs that are of a
pithy nature in the centre of the wood, as the presence of water will
quickly cause the stems to rot and render the plant unsightly, even if
it escapes serious injury. All stems that are an inch or more in
diameter should be tarred over to keep out the wet, which either rots
them directly or injures them indirectly by making a moist, congenial
home for the various fungoid diseases to which so many of our exotic
trees and shrubs are liable.

Many shrubs which have been in one place for some years, and which have
become stunted or poorly flowered, are often given a new lease of life
by a hard pruning in the winter, cutting away all the old wood entirely,
and shortening the remainder. With a good feeding at the same time, they
will throw up strong young shoots, full of vigour, which will bear fine
and well-coloured flowers. Of course, a season of blooming will be lost
by doing this, but it will be amply compensated for in after years by a
healthy plant in place of a decrepit and unsightly one. The list
appended includes practically every flowering tree and shrub _hardy_ in
this country, with the proper time of pruning it. Those not specified
flower on the old wood.

When shrubs that by nature flower freely and are rightly placed with
regard to soil and position refuse to bloom, root pruning will sometimes
effect an alteration.

[Illustration: _CEANOTHUS AZUREUS AT KEW._]

ABELIA.--This genus is barely hardy, and, in most localities, is usually
pruned sufficiently or too much by frost. A moderate thinning of the
shoots in spring is sufficient.

ACANTHOPANAX.--There are three species of this genus hardy in this
country, and of these _A. ricinifolium_ requires no pruning beyond the
cutting away of side-shoots to a single stem, as it attains the
dimensions of a tree in Japan, its native country. _A. sessiliflorum_
and _A. spinosum_ are low-growing shrubs, and require an occasional
thinning out, which is best done in late summer to allow the remainder
to thoroughly ripen before winter.

[Illustration: _CEANOTHUS AZUREUS, VAR. MARIE SIMON._]

ACTINIDIA.--A climbing genus, easily grown in warm, sheltered
localities. They require very little pruning, but should be watched in
spring when growth has commenced, or the twining shoots will get into a
tangled and unsightly mass. Any growth not required should be cut away
in winter.

ÆSCULUS (Horse-Chestnut).--The common representative of this requires
little or no pruning, but the other species are benefited by a thinning
out of misplaced and useless branches in late summer to allow light and
air to the centre of the tree. This is especially important to all the
Æsculus in a young state. _Æsculus parviflora_ should have a good
thinning if the branches or suckers become at all thick, cutting all
growths not required clean away from the base.

AKEBIA.--"_Akebia quinata_ has flowered here, on an east wall, profusely
for the last seventeen years, under the following pruning treatment:
Cover the space allotted with the strongest shoots, and when new growth
pushes from the eyes or spurs in the spring, do not regulate it, but
summer-prune away all superfluous growth before it gets entangled. It is
from 'spurs' that the flowers are produced, and the more these are kept
clear, the more matured they become, and flower correspondingly."--E. M.
in _The Garden_.

AMELANCHIER.--These should be pruned after the flowers are past, the
removal of badly-placed and weakly shoots being all that is required. If
the plants are becoming too large, they can be shortened back at the
same time.

AMORPHA.--If flowers are desired of _A. fruticosa_ it should be kept
thinned out, and not be cut back; but the flowers are not showy, and it
is usually kept cut down every winter for the sake of its foliage. _A.
canescens_ should be cut down each spring to within two or three eyes of
the old wood, as it flowers best on the young growth.

ANDROMEDA.--The only recognised species of this genus is _A. polifolia_,
which requires no pruning.

ARALIA.--These should be kept to a single stem until they have attained
a height of 6 to 8 feet, after which they may be allowed to branch, or
be still kept to a single stem, as may be desired.

ARBUTUS.--An evergreen genus which requires no pruning.

ARISTOLOCHIA.--A genus of climbers which succeed best if the shoots are
not allowed to become too thick. The weakest should be cut away in
winter.

ARTEMISIA.--This genus is best known by its common representative, the
Southernwood, but this and the other Artemisias should be cut down
annually in a young state. When older, an occasional thinning out of the
shoots in winter is sufficient.

BACCHARIS.--Of this, _B. halimifolia_ flowers on the young wood and
should be cut back annually, while _B. patagonica_ should not be pruned
at all.

BERBERIS.--Properly the Berberis requires no pruning, but the
stronger-growing species, such as _B. aristata_, _B. Lycium_, _B.
virescens_, _B. vulgaris_, &c., require an occasional thinning to keep
them within bounds.

BERCHEMIA.--A climbing genus which requires no pruning.

BRUCKENTHALIA.--A dwarf-growing Ericaceous genus, the seed-pods of which
should be removed as soon as the flowers are past, or the plants will be
seriously weakened.

BRYANTHUS.--This should be treated the same as the last, which it
somewhat resembles.

BUDDLEIA.--Of these, _B. variabilis_, _B. japonica_, and _B. intermedia_
flower on the young wood and require cutting back every winter to within
two or three eyes of the old wood; _B. globosa_ need not be pruned at
all, except in a young state to keep it bushy; and _B. paniculata_ only
requires thinning out if it becomes too thick, which is not a very
common occurrence.

CALLUNA (the Ling).--This and its numerous varieties should have the old
flowers cut off as soon as they are past, and any long or straggling
growth cut back at the same time.

CALOPHACA.--The solitary representative of this genus is rather inclined
to become straggly if growing at all freely. When this is the case, the
plant is benefited by the cutting back of the longer shoots in winter.

CALYCANTHUS.--These require an occasional thinning of the branches, and
any long shoots may be shortened with advantage.

CAMELLIA.--These, which should be grown outdoors much more than they
are, should be cut down if they get unhealthy or unshapely, which should
be done in April. Otherwise no pruning is required.

CARAGANA.--Cut away all the straggling or misplaced branches.

CARMICHÆLIA.--Requires no pruning.

CASSANDRA.--See CALLUNA.

CASSINIA.--These are grown more for their foliage than for their
flowers, and should be cut down in the winter or early spring. This can
be done annually or biennially according to whether the plants are
growing strongly or not.

CASSIOPE.--See CALLUNA.

CATALPA.--This genus contains some of our handsomest flowering trees,
all of which require careful pruning after the flowers are past,
thinning out the weakly wood, and shortening any long branches.

CEANOTHUS.--Of these, _C. americanus_, _C. azureus_, _C. integerrimus_,
and the garden hybrids, such as "Gloire de Versailles," "Marie Simon,"
"Ceres," &c., flower on the young wood, and should be cut back in
spring, allowing only sufficient shoots to remain to form a
well-balanced plant, and shortening them back to within two or three
eyes of the old wood. The remaining species flower on the old wood, and
merely require a shortening back of the stronger shoots and a thinning
out of the weakly ones after the flowers are past.

CELASTRUS.--A climbing genus of strong and vigorous habit with showy
fruits. They only require sufficient pruning in winter to keep them
within bounds.

CERCIS.--Requires no pruning, except such as may be necessary to make
well-shaped plants, which should be done after flowering.

CHIMONANTHUS.--The shoots of this should be shortened back after
flowering, and if on a wall they should be spurred in.

CHIONANTHUS.--See CERCIS.

CHOISYA TERNATA.--This only needs thinning after the flowers are over
and old wood removed.

CISTUS.--Those which are hardy of this genus should be cut back each
spring while in a young state, but when they have attained a flowering
size no pruning is required. The cutting back of young plants induces a
bushy habit, and also keeps them from weakening themselves by blooming
and seeding.

CLEMATIS.--The garden forms of this genus are divided into two sections,
of which _C. Jackmani_, _C. lanuginosa_, _C. Viticella_, and _C.
aromatica (C. cærulea odorata)_ are the types of those which flower on
the young wood, and which require cutting back close to the old wood in
the winter; while _C. florida_, _C. patens_, and _C. montana_ are the
types of those which flower on the ripened wood of the previous year,
and merely require a thinning out of weakly or unnecessary growth. Of
species other than those mentioned above, _C. Flammula_, _C.
paniculata_, and _C. Vitalba_ flower on the young wood; and the
remaining species are either herbaceous or flower on the old wood.

CLERODENDRON TRICHOTOMUM.--Thin in spring.

CLETHRA.--These practically require no pruning, but long shoots may be
shortened and weakly ones cut away with advantage.

COLUTEA.--These make better plants and flower later if they are cut back
every winter. _C. istria_ (a rare species) should not be cut down if
flowers are desired.

CORNUS.--The strong-growing shrubby Cornus, such as _C. alba_, _C.
Amomum_, _C. Baileyi_, _C. pubescens_, and _C. stolonifera_ require an
annual thinning out, and those with brightly-coloured stems should be
cut down every spring for their effect during the following winter. The
remaining Cornus require little or no pruning.

COTONEASTER.--The large-growing species should be pruned in late summer,
but only sufficiently to keep them within bounds; _C. Simonsii_ requires
cutting down annually while young to make it bushy, and the
dwarf-growing kinds are best left alone.

CRATÆGUS.--Keep the heads well thinned out to allow light and air to the
centre of the tree. This should be done in late summer.

CYTISUS.--These require very little pruning, with the exception of _C.
nigricans_ and _C. capitatus_, which flower on the young wood, and
should be cut back annually. The other species and varieties make better
plants if they are cut down each year while in a small state, but they
should be left alone when they have attained flowering size.

DABOECIA (the Irish Heath).--Cut away all old flower stems in early
winter.

DAPHNE.--Requires no pruning.

DESMODIUM.--These flower on the young wood, and should be cut nearly to
the ground-line every spring.

DEUTZIA.--The old wood should be kept cut out of these, but no
shortening of young shoots should be attempted.

ELÆAGNUS.--These require an annual overhauling to keep them in good
condition. This should be done in late summer, when the plants should be
well thinned out, and all useless growth cut clean away.

ERICA.--See CALLUNA.

ESCALLONIA.--These are usually cut back by frost; but if they escape,
_E. rubra_ and _E. punctata_ should have their long growths shortened
back in spring, while the other hardy species need not be touched. _E.
macrantha_ simply needs thinning. All the smaller growths in the centre
should be removed. _E. philippiana_ does not like hard cutting back, but
the old stumps must be cut out to make room for flowering wood.

[Illustration: _PEARL BUSH (Exochorda grandiflora) SHOWING ITS NATURAL
BEAUTY._]

EXOCHORDA.--These usually require no pruning, but if the plants are
getting too large or unshapely, they should be cut back immediately
after flowering.

FATSIA (_Aralia Sieboldii_).--This is usually cut by frost, but it
stands a cutting back in spring, when new growth is soon made which will
flower late in the following autumn.

FOTHERGILLA.--Requires no pruning.

GARRYA ELLIPTICA.--This always flowers on the previous year's wood. Need
only be thinned to ripen the new growth.

GENISTA.--_G. tinctoria_ flowers on the young wood, and should be cut
back every spring. The other species of Genista should not be pruned,
except to keep them in shape.

HALESIA.--These are small trees or large shrubs, and should not be
shortened back, but are improved if the growths are kept thinned out,
which should be done after the flowers are past.

HALIMODENDRON.--Requires no pruning.

HAMAMELIS.--Thin out regularly, as they are very apt to get thick and
make weakly growths.

HEDYSARUM MULTIJUGUM.--This flowers on the young wood, and should be cut
back lightly each spring. The growths can also be pegged down to improve
the plant, which is apt to get straggling.

HELIANTHEMUM.--Cut away all dead flowers and seed-pods after blooming.

HIBISCUS.--Thin out in winter, but only shorten the longest shoots.

[Illustration: _HYDRANGEA PANICULATA GRANDIFLORA (unpruned plant)._]

HYDRANGEA.--These flower best on young wood, and should be cut down in
winter. _H. paniculata grandiflora_ should _always_ be cut back to
within two inches of the old wood.

[Illustration: _HYDRANGEA PANICULATA AND VAR. GRANDIFLORA._]

HYPERICUM.--These should be cut back fairly hard in early spring, as
they all flower on the young growth.

INDIGOFERA.--Cut down every spring, as they flower on the young wood.

ITEA.--Keep the growths thinned and cut away all old wood.

JAMESIA.--This should be treated as the preceding.

JASMINUM.--_J. fruticans_ and _J. humile_ are shrubs which should be
thinned regularly; and _J. nudiflorum_ and _J. officinale_ are climbers,
which should be spurred in after flowering.

KALMIA.--Remove seed-pods as soon as the flowers are past.

KERRIA.--Cut away the old wood to encourage the young growths, which
yield the best flowers.

LABURNUM.--These should be thinned after flowering, cutting away the old
or weakly wood, and shortening any long or straggling shoots.

LAVANDULA.--Cut away all flower-spikes after they are past.

LEDUM.--Remove seed-pods after flowering.

LESPEDEZA.--See DESMODIUM, which it much resembles.

LEUCOTHOË.--_L. axillaris_ and _L. Catesbæi_ flower much better if the
old growths are removed and strong young shoots encouraged. The rest of
the genus require no pruning.

LEYCESTERIA.--Thin out old growths every spring.

LIGUSTRUM.--_L. ovalifolium_ and its golden variety are all the better
for being cut down each winter while in a young state. The remainder
merely require an occasional thinning.

LIRIODENDRON.--Requires no pruning.

LONICERA.--The shrubby Loniceras are nearly all inclined to become very
thick and full of weakly shoots if not well looked after. A thinning out
should take place after flowering is past. The climbing Honeysuckles
should only be pruned sufficiently to keep them within bounds.

LYCIUM.--These should be served the same as the shrubby Loniceras, but
the operation should be performed in autumn or winter, as they flower
practically all the summer.

LYONIA.--Requires no pruning.

MAGNOLIA.--Generally speaking, the Magnolias should not be pruned, but
cut away useless or decaying wood. Every wound, however small, on a
Magnolia should be tarred over immediately.

MICROGLOSSA.--The solitary shrubby representative of this is _M.
albescens_, which should be cut down in winter, as it flowers best on
the young wood.

MYRICA.--An occasional thinning is sufficient for this genus.

MYRICARIA.--Flowering on the young wood; this should be cut back every
spring.

NEILLIA.--Thin out every year after flowering is past, cutting back the
old wood to strong young shoots.

NEVIUSIA.--This requires the same pruning as Neillia.

NOTOSPARTIUM.--Requires no pruning.

NUTTALLIA.--The single species of this flowers in February, and is
improved by a good thinning out of the old wood when blooming is past.

OLEARIA.--Requires no pruning.

ONONIS.--_O. rotundifolia_ should be cut down every winter, as it
flowers on the young wood. The remaining species flower on the older
wood, and need not be touched.

OSMANTHUS.--These should not be pruned unless a particular shape is
desired, when the plants may be clipped with a pair of shears in spring.

OXYCOCCUS.--This is a small creeping genus allied to Vaccinium, and
requires no pruning.

OXYDENDRON.--Remove seed-pods.

PALIURUS.--This attains the dimensions of a small tree, and should be
kept trimmed up for that purpose.

PARROTIA.--Thin out in spring after the flowers are past.

PAULOWNIA.--Keep to a single stem to a height of about 8 feet, and then
allow it to branch. If used for sub-tropical bedding, it should be cut
down to the ground every winter.

PERAPHYLLUM.--The solitary hardy species of this should not be pruned or
disturbed in any way if it can be avoided.

PERIPLOCA.--A climbing genus which should be thinned out in winter, and
only shortened back if necessary.

PERNETTYA.--These should not be pruned at any time.

PHILADELPHUS.--These should be thinned after flowering, and the old wood
cut back to strong young shoots. This is especially important with _P.
microphyllus_, _P. coronarius_, and _P. Lemoinei_ and its varieties.

PHILLYRÆA DECORA (_Vilmoriniana_).--This well-known shrub needs no
pruning.

PHOTINIA.--Requires no pruning.

PIERIS.--Remove seed-pods.

POTENTILLA.--Thin out after flowering, and shorten any old wood back to
strong young breaks.

PRUNUS.--When young, all the members of this genus that are grafted or
budded are improved by being cut back each spring until they have
attained a fair size and shape. More especially is this the case with
the Almonds, double-flowered Peaches, and the various flowering
Cherries. When older, they need only be thinned and the flowering Plums
and Cherries kept spurred in, but not too hard. _Prunus japonica_, _P.
nana_, and _P. triloba_ should be cut down to strong young breaks after
flowering, the resulting wood bearing better flowers than the old wood.
If any of these three latter are grown on a wall they should be spurred
back hard after blooming.

PTELEA.--When young, trim these to form small trees, and do not allow
them to develop into ungainly bushes. When older, they require an
occasional thinning. _P. trifoliata var. aurea_, a golden form which is
not grown so much as it deserves to be, should be cut back annually or
biennially, the young wood being better coloured and bearing larger
leaves than the old.

PYRUS.--The wild Pears should be spurred in the same manner as adopted
for fruiting Pears, though not quite so hard. The wild Crab-apples, such
as _P. baccata_, _P. floribunda_, _P. spectabilis_, &c., should be cut
back every spring until they have formed well-balanced heads. Afterwards
an annual thinning and a shortening of the longest shoots after
flowering is sufficient. The remaining sections of Pyrus merely require
an occasional thinning. _P. japonica_ should be kept spurred in, whether
growing on a wall or in the open, and in the latter case should not be
allowed to become a mass of weakly shoots.

RHAMNUS.--These should be thinned out if becoming too thick, but, as a
rule, they require very little pruning.

RHODODENDRON (including AZALEA).--Remove all seed-pods immediately the
flowers are over, and any plants that are in a sickly condition should
be cut down at the same time. By doing this a season or two of flower is
lost, but it is practically the only means of bringing a weakly plant
back to health again.

RHODOTYPUS.--Cut away old wood, and encourage the strongest of the young
growths.

RHUS.--Keep these well thinned out, and destroy all suckers that appear,
unless wanted for stocks. Gloves should always be worn when handling any
of the Rhus, as the sap of _all_ is poisonous to a certain extent. _R.
Toxicodendron_ is _very poisonous_. This should never be forgotten. If
used for sub-tropical gardens cut down to within two eyes of the base.
Select the strongest eye and rub the other off. Always use gloves in
handling this shrub. It should never be planted where children have
access to it.

RIBES.--All the Ribes are improved by being cut down annually while in a
young state, but when older, a yearly thinning out of the old wood is
sufficient.

ROBINIA.--This is a genus that requires very little pruning when the
members of it have attained a fair size, an occasional thinning being
all that is necessary. In a young state they require well staking, and
the longest shoots should be shortened back, as many of them are
top-heavy when young.

ROSA.--Although the various garden Roses come under this heading, yet
they are a class apart, and are better dealt with by specialists. The
species of Rosa do not require any shortening of their shoots, which
should always be left at full length, but all of them should have an
annual thinning out of the old wood, either cutting it right away or
back to a young shoot. Some of the species are very prone to throw up
suckers from underground sometimes to a considerable distance from the
plant, and these should always be dug out and got rid of; merely cutting
them off only producing two evils in the place of one.

RUBUS.--This genus includes the Blackberry and Raspberry, and in a
modified form the treatment accorded to them for fruiting is the best to
employ with the ornamental Rubi, that is, all old wood that has flowered
should be cut away and strong young canes encouraged. But while in the
cultivation of the Raspberry only a few young canes are allowed to grow,
in the ornamental species practically every young growth should be
utilised. The double-flowered Rubi should have some of the old wood
left, as they do not make so much young growth as the single ones do.

SANTOLINA.--This is a dwarf-growing genus, the old flower-heads of which
should be cut away as soon as they are past, and any long or straggling
growths cut back at the same time.

SAMBUCUS.--The elders require very little pruning as a rule, but the
various cut-leaved, golden, or variegated forms are improved by being
cut back annually. This will prevent them flowering, but as good foliage
is required the loss of the bloom is a matter of little consequence.

SKIMMIA.--Requires no pruning.

SMILAX.--The hardy species of this genus do not require any pruning if
they have room to ramble. If space is restricted, thin out and shorten
in autumn.

SOPHORA.--These should be kept thinned when they have attained flowering
size; in a young state they should be kept to a single stem and induced
to form well-shaped trees.

SPARTIUM.--This should be cut back in a small state, but when older it
requires no pruning whatever.

SPIRÆA.--Though all the Spiræas will flower on the old wood, the
following are better for being cut back in winter to form young
flowering shoots, viz., _S. betulifolia_, _S. Douglasi_, _S. Foxii_, _S.
japonica_, _S. Margaritæ_, _S. salicifolia_, _S. semperflorens_, _S.
tomentosa_, and many of their varieties and hybrids. The remaining
Spiræas should be kept thinned out, and if any are making strong young
breaks from the lower part of the plant they can be cut back to them
after flowering.

STACHYURUS.--This should be thinned out after flowering.

STAPHYLEA.--_S. pinnata_ should be kept thinned in late summer; _S.
colchica_ and _S. Coulombieri_ require very little pruning, but if too
tall or unshapely should be cut back immediately after flowering.

STUARTIA  } Require no pruning.
STYRAX    }

SUÆDA.--Cut back occasionally to keep it from getting ragged.

SYMPHORICARPUS.--Keep these well thinned out, which should be done in
late summer.

SYRINGA (Lilac).--these should be kept free of suckers, especially the
finer-named kinds, which are usually worked on stocks of the Common
Lilac. In addition, disbudding may be practised with advantage in the
spring, removing the majority of the blind shoots and any flowering or
leading shoots that are misplaced or not required. This should be done
twice or thrice at intervals of ten days or a fortnight.

TAMARIX.--Cut back in a young state, but when older they should not be
pruned at all.

VACCINIUM.--The removal of any old or rough wood is sufficient for
these.

VIBURNUM.--All the Viburnums grow thickly, and require an annual
thinning.

VITIS.--The methods practised in growing Vines for fruit suit the
ornamental species as well. If space is restricted they should be grown
on the spur system, and if there is plenty of room then the extension
system may be employed.

WISTARIA.--These should be kept spurred in, with the exception of the
leading shoots, which merely require a shortening in early spring
according to the strength of the plant.

XANTHOCERAS.--Requires no pruning.

ZENOBIA.--These require no pruning as a rule, but occasionally a hard
cutting back will induce healthy growth in place of a weakly one.

THINNING.--It will be gathered from these notes that thinning out only
is needful in many cases. If judicious thinning were more practised
English gardens would be more beautiful. It promotes internal growth and
a wealth of flowers.

Pruning is frequently carelessly and ignorantly done, and this applies
especially to forest trees. There are certain tools that may be used for
the purpose. Under ordinary circumstances only a few are necessary, and
these should always be of the best quality, sharp, clean, and always
kept ready for use. Take the pruning knife for example. If this is not
sharp it is impossible to make the necessary _clean_ cut. The surface
will be jagged and rough, and probably promote disease. Some prefer
_secateurs_, and while admitting their value for pruning purposes, a
good sharp knife is preferable; it is not so heavy, and does not tire
the hand. There are several of these implements in the market, but the
best that has come under my notice is the "improved double cutting"; it
is easy to work and cuts clean. For standard trees use the "Standard
Tree Pruner."




CHAPTER VII

PROPAGATION OF HARDY TREES AND SHRUBS


If we were to take many books about trees and shrubs or general
gardening as a guide, one might be led to think that only one way of
increasing a tree or shrub existed, and that by grafting; but, as we
have pointed out elsewhere, it is a mischievous practice when
indiscriminately applied. It is _not_ contended by this that grafting
and budding are utterly needless, as in many instances these methods may
be rightly adopted, but the four natural ways of increase are by layers,
seeds, suckers, and cuttings. Many trees and shrubs are much better when
grafted upon other stocks.

Of these, practise seed-raising whenever possible; but if seeds cannot
be procured, then adopt other ways, and the man is wise who tries to
keep a plant on its own roots. Neither budding nor grafting should be
resorted to, unless other means fail absolutely. When standard trees
cannot be got true from seed, budding or grafting must be practised, and
the evils of these methods of propagation are not so pronounced in such
cases as with dwarf plants. With the former, suckers, or growths from
the stock, are easily seen as soon as they appear, but with dwarf
plants a perfect forest of suckers may seriously weaken the plant before
they are noticed.

SEEDS.--These can be sown at almost any time, but the spring is the
best, as those which germinate quickly have time to form strong young
plants before the following winter. Some take two years to come up, and
should be left in the ground. This refers more to seeds sown outdoors,
and few hardy trees and shrubs require heat to assist germination. When
sown in the open the beds should be made on a fairly rich, moist piece
of ground, protected from cold winds, but fully exposed to the sun.
After the seeds are sown, cover them with light tiffany shading, fir
branches, or heather, but the first is best, as it is easily removed to
attend to the bed. Conifers especially should be sown in beds, whether
indoors or outdoors, as pot-culture results in the roots taking the
shape of the pot, and never afterwards recovering from their cramped
condition. It must be remembered, however, that varieties cannot be
depended upon to come true from seed, though by careful selection for a
few years many varieties will almost reproduce the characteristics of
the parents. Hybrids, such as _Berberis stenophylla_, _Hypericum
moserianum_, and many others, also do not come true from seed, so that
cuttings, layers, or division of the old plants must be the practice
chosen.

SUCKERS.--Plants which throw up suckers from the base, or below the
ground-line, are easily propagated by detaching these suckers in winter
with a portion of root. They will grow away readily, and soon form good
trees or shrubs as the case may be.

CUTTINGS.--Nearly all the hardy shrubs, and a small proportion of hardy
trees also, can be propagated by cuttings taken at certain times of the
year. Summer cuttings are taken during the last two weeks of May and
throughout June, the actual time depending on the season, and consist of
the young shoots that have grown to a length of 3 to 6 inches. These
should be pulled off with a "heel," and inserted in sandy soil in a
close frame, with brisk bottom heat. The cuttings should be taken on a
dull day, or early in the morning, and kept cool and moist until they
are in the frame. A cutting that has flagged is useless, as it never
revives. Deciduous flowering shrubs are usually propagated by summer
cuttings, which generally root well in a fortnight or less. Autumn
cuttings are taken during August and September, and are made from the
partially ripened growths of the current year, inserted in sandy soil,
in a close frame, without bottom heat. Winter cuttings are made from
thoroughly ripened wood at any time between October and March, and are
laid in rather thickly in rows outdoors, and only about an inch or less
is left above the soil. The majority of our best flowering shrubs are
easily increased in this way.

LAYERS.--Excellent trees and shrubs can be got by layers, and they may
be laid down at any time of the year; they will be ready for removal in
about eighteen months or two years.

BUDDING.--This is done about August, and the same rules apply to trees
and shrubs as to Roses, &c.

GRAFTING.--This takes place outdoors from March to May, at the earlier
time for deciduous trees and shrubs, and later on for evergreens. The
actual time depends upon the season.

Where seed is not expressly mentioned below, it must be understood that
this is the natural, and in many cases the best, way to propagate.

The following trees can only be raised from seed to do any good
afterwards, though a few of them will throw up suckers, which can be
taken off and replanted: _Æsculus_ (Chestnut), _Ailantus_, _Alnus_
(Alder), _Arbutus_, _Betula_ (Birch), _Carpinus_ (Hornbeam), _Carya_
(Hickory), _Castanea_ (Sweet Chestnut), _Celtis_ (Nettle tree), _Fagus_
(Beech), _Fraxinus_ (Ash), _Gleditschia_ (Honey Locust), _Juglans_
(Walnut), _Laburnum_, _Liquidambar_, _Morus_ (Mulberry), _Prunus_,
_Pyrus_, _Quercus_ (Oak), _Sophora_, _Ulmus_ (Elm), and _Zelkova_. The
varieties of any species of the above, and, in fact, of nearly all hardy
trees, must be budded or grafted on the species they are forms of, but
an exotic species should never be worked on the native representative of
the genus--_e.g._ _Æsculus flava_ should not be budded on the Common
Horse Chestnut, as the latter is far too strong a stock for the
smaller-growing Æsculus.

_Acer_ (Maple) and _Tilia_ (Lime or Linden) can be raised from seeds or
by layering, the Lime especially being largely propagated from layers,
which soon form strong young trees. The varieties of Maple are best
worked on stocks of the species they belong to.

_Cratægus_ (Thorn), _Catalpa_, and _Robinia_ (Locust tree), can be
raised from suckers or root-cuttings, if seeds cannot be got. Any of
their varieties are usually budded or grafted on stocks of the parent
species.

_Ilex_ (Holly), _Magnolia_, _Populus_ (Poplar), _Platanus_ (Plane), and
_Salix_ (Willow). The Holly is easily raised from cuttings and layers,
the second roots readily when layered, and the latter three are
propagated in large quantities by winter cuttings. The White Poplar
(_Populus alba_) is an exception, as this can only be increased by
root-cuttings.


INCREASING HARDY SHRUBS

The best of our hardy flowering shrubs are grouped under seven natural
orders, and a knowledge of the order to which a plant belongs is in most
cases a guide to its propagation, as the majority of the species
contained in an order are, as a rule, increased by the same methods.

BERBERIDEÆ.--This contains _Akebia_ and _Berberis_, which are propagated
by seeds, cuttings, or layers. _Berberis stenophylla_ and _B. Neuberti_
do not come true from seed, so that one or both of the other methods
mentioned above must be adopted.

LEGUMINOSÆ.--In this order such genera as _Cytisus_ (Broom), _Genista_
(Rock Broom), _Spartium_ (Spanish Broom), _Ononis_, _Indigofera_,
_Colutea_ (Bladder Senna), _Caragana_ (Siberian Pea tree), and _Cercis_
(Judas tree) should be raised from seed, which is the quickest and best
method of propagation. Cuttings of certain forms of _Cytisus_ and
_Genista_ will root readily, but the plants will sometimes die off just
as they have attained flowering size. _Ulex_ (Furze, Whin, or Gorse) is
propagated by seeds or cuttings, and _Wistarias_ by seeds or by
layering.

ROSACEÆ.--This includes _Prunus_, the shrubby forms of which can, in the
majority of cases, be increased by cuttings or layers; _Spiræa_ and
_Kerria_ (Jews' Mallow), cuttings of which root readily at almost any
time of the year; _Exochorda_ (Pearl Bush), must be raised from seed to
do any good; _Rubus_ (Brambles), some of which can be propagated by
suckers, and the remainder by pegging the points of the shoots down to
form young plants; _Rosa_ (Rose), the species of which should be
increased by seeds, cuttings, or layers, though seeds will not always
come true, as Roses become hybridised very readily; and _Cotoneaster_,
which are increased by seeds, cuttings, or layers.

SAXIFRAGEÆ.--In this order _Hydrangea_, _Deutzia_, _Philadelphus_ (Mock
Orange), _Escallonia_, and _Ribes_ (Flowering Currant) are included. All
are easily propagated by cuttings taken in almost any season of the
year. With the exception of Hydrangea, which should be struck under
glass, all the members of this order root readily outdoors in the
winter.

CAPRIFOLIACEÆ.--This order contains such genera as _Sambucus_ (Elder),
_Viburnum_, _Lonicera_ (Honeysuckle), _Symphoricarpus_ (Snowberry tree),
_Abelia_, _Leycesteria_, and _Diervilla_ (Weigela). All are easily
propagated by cuttings or by layering. The cuttings can be taken at
almost any time of the year, and root quickly, the young plants
attaining a good size by the end of the second year.

ERICACEÆ.--This order includes all the so-called American plants, such
as _Pernettya_, _Gaultheria_, _Leucothoë_, _Andromeda_, _Pieris_,
_Zenobia_, _Erica_ (Heath), _Calluna_ (Common Heather, Ling), _Kalmia_,
_Ledum_, _Clethra_, and _Rhododendron_ (including _Azalea_). These can
all be increased by seeds, layering, and, in addition, the first two by
division of the old plants. _Erica_ and _Calluna_ can also be increased
by cuttings. Seedlings, of course, make the best plants, but layering is
a quicker method, and, in the case of some of the smaller Ericaceæ, one
of the easiest. All the Rhododendrons will not root from cuttings,
though some of the small-flowered ones strike easily, but practically
all may be increased from layers. A few of the showy garden forms cannot
be raised from layers, and have to be grafted on stocks of the common
_R. ponticum_ or _R. catawbiense_.

OLEACEÆ.--This includes both deciduous flowering shrubs and ornamental
evergreens, such as _Syringa_ (Lilac), _Chionanthus_ (Fringe tree),
_Jasminum_ (Jasmine), _Forsythia_, _Ligustrum_ (Privet), _Phillyræa (P.
decora (vilmoriniana)_ is so easily raised from seeds or cuttings that
it is foolish to graft it on the common privet), and _Osmanthus_ being
represented. The first two are best propagated by seeds or layers,
though the named garden Lilac is usually grafted on stocks of the common
_S. vulgaris_, a silly practice. It is a pitiful business keeping down
suckers from grafted plants. Ask for Lilacs on their own roots, and much
vexation will be saved. A garden should be a place of rest and pleasure,
not a hunting-ground for suckers. The other genera are readily raised by
cuttings taken at almost any time of the year, or by layering.

Although the above orders include a considerable number of our best
shrubs, several plants must be specially mentioned. The Clematis is
increased by seeds, cuttings, or layers in the case of the species, but
unfortunately the garden forms are usually grafted on _C. Viticella_ or
_C. Flammula_, whereas many can be propagated by cuttings, and
practically all will root when layered.

[Illustration: _TULIP TREE AT RANELAGH (Winter)._]

In the absence of seeds the following genera must be propagated by
layers, viz., _Aucuba_, _Chimonanthus_ (Winter Sweet), _Halesia_
(Snowdrop tree), _Hamamelis_ (Witch Hazel), _Hippophaë_ (Sea Buckthorn),
and _Myrica_ (Candleberry Myrtle). Cuttings of the first will root
readily enough, but never seem to succeed afterwards. The female form of
_Hippophaë_ is best raised from layers, as seedlings usually give a
large percentage of male plants. _Aralia_ and _Rhus_ (Sumach) are
increased by seeds or root-cuttings; _Buddleia japonica_ is best raised
from seeds, and the other Buddleias from cuttings; and practically all
other hardy shrubs that have not been specially mentioned are easily
propagated by seeds, cuttings, or layers, and the majority of them by
all three methods.

If it is impossible to increase a tree or shrub by any other means than
by the three methods mentioned, then resort to budding or grafting.

CHAPTER VIII

A WINTER GARDEN OF TREES AND SHRUBS


The budding spring, the ripening summer, the outpoured riches of
harvest, appeal to all, physically if not spiritually. But to hundreds
of people a winter landscape is dreary beyond expression. They never
dream of going into a garden during the dark months; to them its silent
lessons are but a dead-letter, nor would they ever wake to the beauty of
bare boughs nor pause to note the strange glow of withered Fern fronds
in the grey gloom of a foggy day. We are not wholly free from blame in
this matter in so far as our gardens are concerned, for spring and
summer and autumn all have their share in the garden plan, while winter,
too often, stands apart uncared for and unclothed. Yet how much may be
done by the right grouping of beautiful trees and shrubs to make the
winter garden harmonious and inviting.

"You see, it takes a deal of insight to know what's a-going to be," was
a remark, half-apologetic, half-regretful, often made by an old gardener
of a school now gone by, when matters horticultural went somewhat
athwart of his calculations. The words recur to mind as containing a
germ of truth beyond the meaning of the speaker. It has been well said
with regard to deeper matters that foresight must spring from insight,
and it may be taken also as a foundation principle of good gardening.
For just in proportion as we use our faculties of insight and foresight
will our gardens grow, more or less, into a perfect expression of our
sense of the ever-changeful, never-ending beauty of Nature.

It must be no cursory glance given to get rid of an unwelcome duty. We
must look deep into the meaning of things as they are--a meaning which
never lies wholly on the surface--before we can forecast them as they
are going to be, and such insight rarely comes by intuition. The seeing
eye is given only to a few, though with some it is but sleep-holden and
needs no more than to be awakened.

The things that are and the things that are to be. Let us take the
thought as company and try to glean some of Nature's own lessons of
fitness. How instinctively we seek, for a winter ramble, the shelter of
the woodland copse, which is not far distant from any English country
habitation. The broad grass drive is hoar with frosty rime in the shadow
of the bushes and crisp under foot. Under the trees the ground on either
side is carpeted with Ivy. The lithe, trailing stems, wreathed with
their shining, taper-fingered leaves, so exquisitely pencilled, are
cushioned on the soft, feathery moss, or twine in and out amongst the
Hazel stocks, or creep at will up the nearest tree trunk. One can
scarcely look at Ivy on a winter's day without a thrill of admiration,
especially this woodland sort, for, mark it well, Nature never
encourages the coarse-leaved Ivy of common cultivation within her
domains. How perfect in its grace is this fine-leaved Ivy, how utterly
content with its surroundings, how resolutely cheerful, be the
circumstances of weather or situation what they may! Clinging lowly to
the ground or mounting to the topmost branch of some tall Pine, it is
equally at home, and why should we not agree with that good naturalist,
Charles Waterton, in his assertion that forest tree was never injured by
its clasping stems? An English plant for our English climate, it may be
used to make beautiful an unsightly building, to clothe a decaying tree
stump, as bush or border or mantle, in a hundred different ways, yet it
is never out of character, and never touches a jarring note.

Then those tall Hollies, see how dauntlessly they stand up above the
undergrowth of Hazel. How living and warm, in their ruddy glow, are the
clustering berries in the glint of the fearless leaves. For expedience
sake, their lower branches have been trimmed away, and greatly we gain
by it, for otherwise that lovely contrast of their ashen-grey stems
would be hidden from our eyes; but over yonder a fine old Holly tree
stands alone, which axe and knife have left untouched, and how graceful
is the curven sweep of its feathering boughs. No foreign evergreen can
excel it for symmetry of form or winter garniture of leaf and fruit.
Life is astir, too, in the brown twigs of the Hazel bushes. The infant
year is not more than a week or two old, yet already the tasselled
catkins are swinging in the lightest rustle of the sighing wind, and
begin to lift up their tiers of small woolly cowls to set free the
yellow pollen-dust. And so we may go on our way, and, at every turn,
some rugged Yew, or clump of red-stemmed Scotch Fir, or tapering Spruce
with hanging russet cones, will stay our steps, and if we look and
listen, they will tell us in their own way the story of their perfect
fitness for our homely English landscape. Or, if we chance to be in one
of the chalky districts of the South Downs, we may come upon Box, the
ever young, as it was called of yore, or Juniper, in its bloom of silver
grey, as precious as any, to add to the tale of our best native
evergreens.

Now it is to a wise choice of evergreens and to their rightful placing
that we must look for the basis of our content in the winter garden. The
insight of our forefathers foresaw the solid comfort of the rampart of
Yew which was fostered of old in many a manor-house garden. It caused
them to fence about their dwellings on north and east with a belt of
sturdy timber trees, to meet and ward off in their pliant strength the
roughest winter gales. It planned the sheltered nut-walk and the
pleached alley and the cosy settle, carved out of the thick Box bushes,
on the grassy verge of the bowling-green. They took of the materials at
hand, and many have since their day blessed the foresight which planted,
not only for themselves, but for their children's children. That they
were not blind to the rare beauty of foreign trees many a magnificent
Cedar of Lebanon and massive Holm Oak or deciduous tree--like the fine
Tulip trees at Mackery End, beloved of Charles Lamb--bear noble
testimony to this hour.

Nothing, perhaps, in the wide range of garden beauty is more pictorial
than an ancient Cedar, dusky and glaucous, with cavernous shadows,
holding upright the smooth, pale-brown, rounded cones on its flattened
branches, or some grand Silver Fir standing alone in its solemn
symmetrical beauty, or even, as may now and then be seen, though rarely,
some stately Araucaria, wind-sheltered, whose radiating branches sweep
down upon the greensward. Others there are, no less pictorial perhaps,
nor even less exacting, for none can do without the shelter of a good
position, such as the Stone Pines, with corrugated trunk and green
spreading head; or again, the graceful fragrant Cypress (_C.
lawsoniana_) of more recent date, with its slender pyramidal growth and
drooping feathery branches, taking on at the close of winter the
ruby-red of the catkins which tell of the coming of the small,
bloom-powdered cones.

The desperate hurry, the incessant crowding out of the times in which we
live, give little encouragement to the sentiment of planting for
posterity, yet some such planting is continually being done. This much
must be said, that the last fifty years have seen the introduction of
numberless fine trees and shrubs, the fitness of which for our climate
time alone could test. During that period in England, the Mammoth tree
of the Yosemite Valley (_Sequoia gigantea_) has been planted in its
thousands, and by irony of fate, the giant not seldom finds itself
cramped within the limits of a half-acre plot. But leaving out the
question of space, it is a tree utterly unsuited to our northern
climate, unless under exceptional circumstances, as its scorched and
fretted branches on the windward side sufficiently prove; while in
itself it is not nearly so grand or suggestive as its near-of-kin, the
beautiful Californian Redwood (_S. sempervirens_).

Ah! that burning question of space, how it comes between us and our
highest garden aspirations! Have we not all seen the Deodar or the
Araucaria trying to exist in a narrow, twelve-foot forecourt, and
smiled, if we have not rather been ready to weep, over the crass
absurdity of its position? But such mistakes are made every day. Let us
think, then, before we plant, of the things that are going to be, and
take prudent counsel with ourselves.

Our garden resources, nowadays, are beyond all calculation greater than
those of our forefathers, and we rejoice and are glad because of it; but
we should let nothing oust from our affections the hardy trees and
shrubs, native and naturalised, that are at home in our climate,
beautiful in themselves and invaluable in their fitness to give shelter
to the more fastidious immigrants from other latitudes.

Shelter, in fact, is as the keynote to the winter garden. Beauty is
killed when leaves that should be green and smiling are bruised and
brown, when boughs that should be perfect in grace and curve are twisted
and tortured. We may be very sure, too, that such symptoms of discomfort
in our gardens will re-act in disquiet on ourselves, whereas the mere
sight of tree or bush standing firm in its green bravery through storm
and stress tends, it may be unawares, to brace and uplift. Even the
familiar Laurel, good as it is when suitably placed, and used not too
freely, is constantly scathed and disfigured in damp or low-lying
localities. For the same reason, it is doubtful whether Rhododendrons
should be planted within range of our windows. Most of them, in severe
weather, frightened before they are hurt, put on a melancholy air and
droop of leaf which is apt to send a shiver through any shrinking mortal
whose vitality is already low enough.

The bare boughs of winter, on the contrary, are never depressing. They
sleep, but it is not the sleep of death; they rest, but while they are
resting, we feel that the mystery of life silently works out the
fulfilment of the promise of re-awakening. Meanwhile, before the veil of
leafage hides so much else that is beautiful from our eyes, we see the
things that are, tree trunks in all their majesty of girth and column
and fencing bark, the net-work of budding spray, each after its kind
distinct, yet each in its own form perfect. Even in mid-winter, the
brown gummy buds of the Horse Chestnuts begin to swell at the ends of
the swaying boughs, and the Ash-buds, as they make ready to burst their
bonds, put on a deeper hue.

The Beeches keep their silken green tight shut within their scale-bound
points, and will not let it unfold an hour too soon; but look at the
lovely colouring, now silvern, now golden green, of the Lichen-stains on
the smooth grey bark. Contrast it with the deeply-chiselled ribs of the
Sweet Chestnut, the rugged armour-plates of the Oak, the thin white
tissue of the dainty Silver Birch. It is this diversity, these
contrasts, which make up the charm of winter, while the sombre green of
Fir and Yew intermingling with the leafless trees gives just the touch
of warmth and comfort which winter lacks. If any of these bless our
gardens with their gracious presence, let us hesitate long before any
trivial inconvenience tempts us into doing away with them. A single
group of Silver Birches, one spreading Beech, a clump of Scotch Fir,
with a stretch of grass beneath them, is more precious to look out upon
in the winter garden than all the borders and rockeries that can be
devised. Urge as we may, however, for their own sake, the fitness and
constant delight of our native trees and evergreen shrubs, we plead for
them, no less, because by their well-advised use our sheltered gardens
may become congenial abiding-places for the strangers we may invite
within our gates.

Do we profit as much as we might by the wealth of garden beauty, in the
way of trees and shrubs, which for every intent and purpose lies within
our reach?

Take Magnolias, for example. They are not sub-tropical trees, as we are
apt to think, but fairly hardy, and the Laurel Magnolia, so well known
as a beautiful covering for a south wall, is seldom enough seen in
standard form. Yet it is one of the most stately of evergreen trees, and
it would be hard to find one more worthy of a good position, sheltered
from north and easterly winds. The whole outline of the tree is noble,
with its broad, shining, russet-backed leaves, a delight to look upon in
winter--nor is it shy, when full-grown, of bearing in late summer its
scented ivory-white lily-cups. It is too much, however, to expect the
lovely-sculptured, crimson-flushed cones, which in warmer climates than
ours open about November to disclose their hanging scarlet seeds. Some
of the deciduous Magnolias, too, such as the fine Chinese Yulan (_M.
conspicua_) and the bushy white-flowered Japanese species (_M.
stellata_), are full of interest, even while lifeless. All through the
winter we may watch the gradual filling out of the hairy, conical
flower-bracts, until at length, in very early spring, the impatient buds
can contain themselves no longer, and all too soon, sometimes, push them
off altogether that they may creep out of their prison bands.

Every one has his private calendar, and reckons the seasons by a
computation of his own, but we may safely say that four long months, if
no more, separate the falling of the leaf from its coming again.
Perhaps we ought not to include Magnolias amongst hibernal flowers,
though the trees are often white with blossom before the Larch is green;
but the list of shrubs which bloom, or are bright with coloured fruit
during those four months, would surprise most people who think of winter
only as the dead season. The boughs of Sea Buckthorn are loaded with
orange berries. Clusters of scarlet peep out of the fresh green of the
Skimmia bushes and, so long as the birds do not find them out,
_Pernettya_ carries a crop of purple and crimson and pink fruit more
showy than the modest white flowers of summer. When November days are
growing dark, _Coronilla_, in sheltered spots, puts forth its pale
clustering yellow flowers. Winter Jasmine, if the flowering branches are
not ruthlessly pruned away in autumn, covers its long green shoots with
golden stars. The evergreen Clematis (_C. calycina_) is never happier
than when clinging to some terrace balustrade where it may have a little
kindly shelter, which it repays by wreathing the stone-work with
garlands of finely-cut bronzed foliage, hung with creamy freckled bells.
More than one kind of hardy Heath, if grown in spreading masses, will
deck the garden with sheets of colour the whole winter through.

The Chinese Honeysuckle (_L. Standishii_) arrays itself in its fragile
white flowers as early as January. Witch Hazels hang their bare branches
with twisted petals of gold or amber or, sometimes (as in _Hamamelis
zuccariniana_), borrow the pale-green tint of the under wing of a
brimstone butterfly. Soon after Christmas, Mezereon flushes into rosy
purple, and bushes of Winter-sweet (_Chimonanthus fragrans_),
independent of a wall (as few people know), will breathe out its perfume
from leafless branches studded over with waxen-yellow flowers. It is
strange how many of these winter-blooming plants keep their leaves well
out of harm's way, brave as their flowers may be. But so it is, and so
we learn that if we would gain their fullest winter beauty, we must
group them with evergreen shrubs as foil or background.

And what store there is of these to choose from, not green only, but
colour-tinged--_Berberis_ of many kinds, the shining ordered leaf-rows
of _Azara_, the purple tints of _Mahonia_ and _Gaultheria_, the bronze
of _Andromeda_ buds, the deep dull green of _Osmanthus_, the wine red of
_Leucothoë_, the pearl grey of _Atriplex_, and a hundred more will
respond to our beck and call. Only we must choose with judgment, for
whether our lot is cast in north or south, in the black east or soft
caressing west, makes all the difference to our choosing. Only be sure
that more important still than climate are the wind-breaks we can plan,
and the shelter we may contrive. Yet when we are in doubt we can always
come back with satisfaction to the quick-growing hardiest shrubs and
find in them some fit setting for our garden picture. The slender angled
branches of green Broom, the rigid spiny Furze, scented Rosemary, or
hoary Lavender--all will lend their varied tints and attributes as we
need them. And if a pool or stream only gives us opportunity, what can
surpass the winter colouring of osier twigs--golden and crimson and
olive, mirrored in still water or broken into a thousand reflections by
the ripple of a running brook?

Perhaps, amongst all the wealth of winter evergreen shrubs the rank of
those which show variegation is too much exaggerated. Popular as they
are, the effect is not always good, unless more than ordinary care is
taken in their placing. Some few, like the best golden and silver
Hollies, are very beautiful, though not all of these are improvements
upon the finest green forms. No variegated shrub, probably, is more
universally grown than the Aucuba, and it has excellent points; it is
hardy in constitution, handsome in outline, and bold of leaf. By
ill-luck, as it happened, more than a hundred years ago, the spotted
variety was sent home first from Japan, and became domiciled in English
gardens and rooted in English affections before the far more worthy
green species made its entry.

It is but a private opinion and not given as dogma that it might
possibly be a distinct gain to gardens, large and small, if the spotted
Aucuba were practically banished and the true green-leaved forms--some
of which are generally beautiful when well set with large coral
berries--allowed to take its place. The variegated Oleaster (_Elæagnus
pungens_), a remarkably fine shrub when taken by itself, sadly disturbs
the repose and dignity of the garden outlook in winter, though doubtless
positions might be found in which it would harmonise with its
surroundings.

We need only con over, mentally, all the more familiar examples of
shrub variegation to find, probably, that we should do as well without a
goodly proportion of them, though we may frankly admit some to be very
handsome. The secret of our discontent, possibly, lies in the fact that
variegation in plants that are normally green is not, in its essence, a
sign of health but of wasting sickness. In any case, whatever our
feelings may be on this particular point, it is well worth while to
weigh the merits of each shrub, variegated or green, before we plant it,
not only individually, but in relation to its neighbourhood to other
garden associates, and more especially with regard to its winter aspect.

Mr. Bean writes as follows about the winter beauty of trees and shrubs:
"Even in November and December there are trees and shrubs that brighten
the garden with their coloured bark and fruits. Although not abundant,
the members of this class are not used so extensively as they might be.

"Among Willows, for instance, there are the golden and red-barked
varieties of _Salix vitellina_. These, though scarcely ever seen, are
capable, when properly treated, of producing bright warm effects that
are especially charming from November to February. When allowed to grow
naturally this Willow--known popularly as the Golden Osier--forms a
graceful tree of large size. Its twigs have a golden or red tinge,
according to the variety, but on fully-grown trees these twigs are not
large, and as it is, of course, the bark of the preceding summer's
growth only that is coloured no very marked colour effect is produced.
To obtain a really bright patch of colour it is necessary to plant these
Willows in goodly-sized groups and to prune them hard back every spring.
By treating them in this way a great cluster of long, wand-like growths
is made every year, the bark over the whole of which becomes a bright
yellow or red as winter approaches. An effective group is produced by
mixing the red and yellow-barked varieties.

"Another striking Willow is _Salix daphnoides_. The young bark of this
species is covered with a thick glaucous or vivid blue-white 'bloom.'
_S. acutifolia_ is similarly distinguished, though not quite so
markedly. Different from any of these Willows, too, is the variety of
_S. triandra_, with purplish-brown bark. To bring out fully the
ornamental qualities of these Willows they should be treated as advised
for _Salix vitellina_. All these Willows are especially charming near
the edge of water. Not only are their moisture-loving propensities
satisfied, but their beauty is doubled by reflection in the water.

"Somewhat similar to the Willows in the character of their bark, but
useful in being adapted for drier situations, are the Cornels
(_Cornus_). The best of the genus in this connexion are _Cornus alba_
and its variety _sibirica_. They produce bark which for one or two
seasons remains a bright red during the time the branches are leafless.
A group of _Cornus alba_, with _Chionodoxa Luciliæ_ or Winter Aconite
planted thickly beneath, gives a very pleasing bit of colour early in
the year. A yellow-barked form of _Cornus stolonifera_, known as
_flaviramea_, deserves mention.

"Several shrubs are notable for the particularly bright green of their
bark. The forms of _Kerria japonica_ and _Neillia_ are very bright
during the winter on this account, but still more effective is a near
ally, _Stephanandra Tanakæ_, a comparatively new shrub, also from Japan,
but of little value in any other respect. Finally, I may mention the
Rubuses with white stems. As in _Salix daphnoides_, the bark is covered
with the waxy secretion known as 'bloom,' and of a blue-tinted white.
Some six or seven species of Rubus have this character. Of those
obtainable from nurseries, _R. biflorus_, a Himalayan species often to
be had from dealers under the erroneous name of _Rubus leucodermis_, is
the best. Dr. A. Henry has introduced a Chinese species, _Rubus
lasiostylus_, which is even better than _biflorus_; the bloom is more
distinctly blue, and the stems sturdier and more self-supporting. The
species is, however, an extremely rare one in cultivation. It is
scarcely necessary to repeat how essential it is that these Brambles and
Cornels should be planted in bold groups.

"Among trees the most noteworthy as regards the colour of their bark are
the Birches. The beauty of the Common White Birch has not been
overlooked by planters. A single specimen or a few grouped together make
a bright winter picture when associated with evergreens. The Canoe Birch
of North America (_Betula papyrifera_) has a bark of an even purer
white than our native species. The Yellow Birch (_B. lutea_) shows warm
orange-brown tints on the more recently exposed surfaces of its bark.
The bark of the River Birch (_B. nigra_) is not brightly coloured, being
of a dull dark brown, but it gives the tree a notably curious aspect
owing to the way it stands out from the trunk and branches in great
ragged-looking flakes.

A FLOWER GARDEN IN WINTER

"It is possible to make a new feature in gardens by setting apart a
piece of ground exclusively for the cultivation of trees, shrubs, and
bulbs--in short, any plants that flower or are bright with fruit or bark
between, say, the beginning of November and the end of February. One
might term it 'an outdoor winter garden.' For the purpose there would be
required a well-drained piece of ground, the soil of which was fertile
and open. The situation should be fully exposed to the south and west,
but guarded well on the north and east sides by a thick belt of
evergreen trees and shrubs. The shelter would be still more complete if
the site sloped rather steeply to the south-west. Such shelter would be
welcome, not only to the plants that grew there, but to those who might
visit and tend them. Some of the more noteworthy trees and shrubs with
ornamental barks I have already mentioned. Plants that carry their fruit
into winter might be included, such as the Hollies, especially the
yellow-berried Holly; _Cratægus Crus-Galli_ and _C. cordata_;
_Cotoneaster rotundifolia_, which is the best of all the Cotoneasters,
and frequently carries its bright-scarlet berries till March; and
_Hippophaë rhamnoides_, the Sea Buckthorn, whose orange-coloured fruits
are borne in such profusion and retain their colour till past Christmas
if the frosts are not too severe. The scarlet-fruited _Skimmia japonica_
and its varieties are very ornamental during the winter months, but of
these (as well as the Hippophaë) it is necessary to grow male and female
plants together. Groups of variegated evergreens would not only help to
give shelter and warmth, but would also add to the brightness of the
garden. The best of them are the golden and silver variegated
Elæagnuses, the Hollies of a similar character, and the best of the
Aucubas, of which there are now some very fine forms; the female plants
are also very ornamental as fruit-bearers. _Pinus sylvestris aurea_, a
variety of the Scotch Pine that turns golden in winter but is green at
other seasons, and _Cupressus macrocarpa lutea_ are the two best
Conifers of their class. Many of the variegated Conifers lose most or
all of their colour as autumn and winter approach.

[Illustration: _ULMUS ALATA._]

"With regard to the trees and shrubs that bear flowers between November
and February, the number is not, of course, great; still, they
constitute a group that is larger, perhaps, than is generally supposed.
The following list, which comprises all that I can call to mind, may be
useful even to those who would not intend to bring them together in one
spot. Some country houses are only occupied during the shooting and
hunting seasons, and these winter-flowering plants are of especial value
in such places. The tree or bush Ivies are very beautiful, and may be
had in great variety, such as yellow berried, _palmata aurea_,
_rhomboidea ovata_, and _amurensis_."

CHAPTER IX

TREES AND SHRUBS WITH BEAUTIFUL CATKINS


When thinking of trees and shrubs in early spring we must remember those
with beautiful catkins. Of the earliest flowering hardy trees and shrubs
the majority are those with flowers borne in catkins. Their appearance
is one of the first evidences of the approach of spring. It is to the
catkin-bearing group that the Poplars, Willows, Birches, and Alders
belong. These catkins are pendulous, cylindrical, and often slender
inflorescences, carrying flowers of one sex only, which spring from the
axils of scaly bracts. Being mainly dependent upon the wind for their
fertilisation, they have none of the varied or bright colours that are
characteristic of flowers fertilised by insect agency. Often, indeed,
sepals and petals are entirely absent. Still, many of these
catkin-bearers possess a charm and beauty of their own, which, taken
with the early, often inclement, season when they appear, make the best
of them indispensable in gardens where early spring effects are desired.
As a rule it is the male or pollen-bearing catkins that are most
ornamental. They are longer and more graceful than the seed-bearing
ones.


POPLARS

First among Poplars to bear its flowers, and almost before winter is
past, is the Aspen (_Populus tremula_). This and its weeping variety
bear their catkins in February, but closely following it, and perhaps
more ornamental, is the American Aspen (_P. tremuloides_). This species
flowers early in March near London in mild seasons, but later further
north, and when kept back by severe weather. The pendulous variety of
_P. tremuloides_--known commonly as Parasol de St. Julien--is, at the
flowering time, probably the most beautiful and striking of all
catkin-bearing trees. This and also the type produce long, slender
catkins that sway gently in the softest winds. The weeping variety,
which has branches that weep naturally low, looks well by itself on a
lawn. In all these Poplars the male catkins are three inches to four
inches long, chiefly grey-brown in colour; the scale-like bracts,
however, are suffused with a reddish shade. The weeping varieties of
these two Aspens are frequently grafted on the White Poplar, which is
not a suitable stock. The species to which the varieties severally
belong should be used for the purpose. It would be even better if they
could be got on their own roots by means of layers or cuttings, and
trained up to the required height before allowing the weeping habit to
develop.

There are other Poplars that bear their catkins freely, such as _P.
alba_, _nigra_, and _balsamifera_, but being of loftier habit they do
not show to the same advantage as those of the Aspen group.


HAZELS

Between the middle and the end of February the flowers on the catkins of
the various species of _Corylus_ begin to expand. Early as that date is,
the catkins have, nevertheless, been in evidence since the previous
autumn; they were, in fact, formed before the nuts fell. Being
comparatively low and shrubby the different varieties of the Hazel
(_Corylus Avellana_) show their catkins to best advantage, and there are
few among the catkin-bearers more charming. It is not often that any but
the coloured-leaved varieties find a place in the garden proper, but
either in the orchard or in the woodland the soft yellow of the Hazel
catkins is one of the most pleasing notes of earliest spring. The Tree
Hazel (_Corylus Colurna_), a fine and interesting tree, growing thirty
feet or more high, also bears its catkins in February.


WILLOWS

Of the almost innumerable species and varieties of _Salix_, it is only a
few that need be mentioned here for their beauty when in flower. So far
as I have been able to judge, the most ornamental of the Willows in
catkin time is _Salix smithiana_, known also as _S. mollissima_. This
tree flowers about mid-March, producing its shortish, thick male catkins
in very great abundance; the numerous exposed anthers give a soft but
glowing yellow tone to the tree, and entitle it to rank as one of the
most ornamental of early-flowering trees. The pendulous variety of
_Salix Capræa_ is known as the Kilmarnock Willow. Although of weeping
habit it is somewhat stiff in character; but towards the end of March
and later it is exceedingly pretty loaded with its grey catkins. The
flowers of the typical _S. Capræa_ (the Goat Willow) are commonly known
in many country places as Palm, and are used for decorating churches on
Palm Sunday. The slender, coloured twigs of the Purple Willow (_Salix
purpurea_) bear red or purplish-tinted catkins in early April. _Salix
stipularis_ may also be mentioned for its beauty when in flower.


ALDERS

With the exception of a few species, such as _Alnus nitida_ and _A.
maritima_, which flower in September and October, all the Alders develop
their blossoms in February and March. The common Alder (_A. glutinosa_)
and its varieties are perhaps as ornamental as any at that time. Like
the Willows, they look best and grow best in association with water. In
such a position an Alder at that time, leafless, but laden with its
slender, greenish-yellow catkins, is a beautiful object, and
characteristic, too, of our English landscape. Other species possessing
a similar quiet beauty are _Alnus incana_, _A. viridis_, _A. oregona_,
and especially _A. cordifolia_ with its green and yellow catkins.


JAPANESE WALNUTS

_Juglans sieboldiana_ and its close allies, _J. mandschurica_ and _J.
cordiformis_, do not flower till May, but bear at that time very
remarkable male catkins. I have measured them over one foot long, and
hanging as they do in goodly number from the branches, perfectly
straight and cylindrical, they have a very striking appearance, although
green. All three species are alike in their catkins, but differ in the
shape of the nuts. They are noteworthy, too, for the imposing character
of their foliage. The leaves are pinnate, and on young trees grown in
good soil are frequently three feet long. They certainly deserve the
notice of planters.


GARRYA ELLIPTICA

From all the catkin-bearers hitherto mentioned, this differs in being
evergreen. It is also far removed from them in relationship, and is
closely allied to the Cornels. At the same time the catkins in external
characteristics are very similar. Not only the catkins but the plants
themselves are unisexual, and, as is usual with the catkin-bearers, it
is the male that is most ornamental. These catkins are from four inches
to eight inches long, and I have heard of (but not seen) them as much as
one foot in length. The time at which the flowers expand depends, as
with all the early catkin-bearers, on the mildness of the season. This
year on a wall the catkins have been in beauty ever since the first week
of January. They are very attractive in their grace and quiet beauty.
Chiefly of soft grey and green colours, the bracts are, however,
suffused with a warmer reddish tint. In the neighbourhood of London
Garrya elliptica is quite hardy in ordinarily sheltered positions, but
does not flower so freely as against a south wall. As it is of
Californian origin this is not surprising. This shrub resents
disturbance at the root, and in transplanting great care is necessary.

There are other species of Garrya in cultivation, but they are more
suitable to the south-western counties than to the average climate of
Britain.

To the catkin-bearing family belong several other well-known trees, such
as the Birches, Hornbeams, and Sweet Chestnut; but flowering later in
the year their beauty is apt to pass without notice in the great flush
of bloom that comes in with April. The beautifully fragrant Sweet Gale
must not be passed without mention. Its reddish brown catkins are formed
before autumn, and expand on the still leafless twigs in spring.




CHAPTER X

AUTUMN COLOURS


There is a mystery about the autumn colouring of the foliage of our many
beautiful hardy trees and shrubs in this country, and we have never yet
ascertained with any degree of exactness the conditions that produce the
richest and brightest tints. Probably the conditions most favourable
generally are provided by a good growing season--that is, a warm, moist
summer--followed by a dry, sunny autumn. But it frequently happens after
what one would regard as favourable seasons, that species which are
usually quite trustworthy in this matter fail to colour well. Probably
one set of conditions does not suit all trees and shrubs in this
respect. To produce the colouration of the leaf just before it falls
certain subtle chemical changes in its composition take place. And to
bring about these changes certain conditions in regard to sunlight,
temperature, and moisture are necessary. But in a climate such as that
of Britain, where the seasons are never alike two years together, we can
never hope to obtain the same regularity of autumnal colouring that
characterises the vegetation, for instance, of the Eastern United
States. Still, when all is said, we possess in our gardens a large
number of trees and shrubs and climbers that are delightful in their
autumnal livery of crimson, purple, scarlet, or gold. It is curious that
every season we may notice species not usually conspicuous for their
autumn tints beautifully coloured.

An over-vigorous, sappy growth, often the result of a wet, warm autumn
or too rich a soil, is certainly detrimental to autumn colouring. _Rhus
cotinoides_, an American Sumach, worth growing for the beauty of its
colours in autumn, is one of the most unfailing in this matter. This is
perhaps one of the loveliest of all autumn-tinted shrubs, and should be
more planted. But young plants, put out in well-trenched,
heavily-manured soil, will often fail to colour at all till they get
older and less vigorous. The most beautifully coloured examples of this
Sumach that we have seen grow in rather light sandy soil. We have
frequently noticed, too, that various species of Vine (_Vitis_) when
starved in pots will colour exquisitely, whilst others, planted out in
the ordinary way, completely fail. We believe, therefore, when planting
with a view to the production of autumnal colour, any great enrichment
of the soil is neither necessary nor advisable, provided it is of
moderate quality to start with.

In the following notes, brief mention is made of some of the best trees,
shrubs, and climbers that colour in autumn:--


TREES

First among these are the American Red Oaks. Undoubtedly the best of
these is a variety of _Quercus coccinea_ known as _splendens_ and
_grayana_. This not only turns to a fine scarlet crimson, but it retains
its foliage for some weeks after the colour has been acquired--sometimes
almost up to Christmas. Other good Oaks, not so certain, however, as the
preceding, are _Quercus marylandica_ (or _nigra_), _Q. heterophylla_,
_Q. imbricaria_, and _Q. palustris_, all of which turn red. The Tupelo
tree (_Nyssa sylvatica_) turns a fine burnished bronzy red. A tree
remarkable for the size of its leaves, and especially for the rich
golden yellow they put on in autumn, is _Carya tomentosa_, but, like
most of the Hickories, it is scarcely known in gardens. _Carya sulcata_
is somewhat similar. The Common Elm is usually very beautiful in the
soft yellow tints of its leaves in autumn, but another Elm of more
distinct aspect is _Ulmus pumila_, a low tree whose small leaves are
retained till late in the year, and turn golden yellow before they fall.
_Liquidambar styraciflua_ has long been valued for its fading foliage of
purple red, but not so well known is the lovely yellow of the Fern-like
foliage of the Honey Locust (_Gleditschia triacanthos_). The Tulip tree
(_Liriodendron_), the Nettle trees (_Celtis_), the _Zelkowas_, and
several of the Birches turn yellow, one of the best of the Birches being
_Betula corylifolia_, which turns a rich orange yellow.

Among commoner trees the yellow of the Horse Chestnut, the lovely
crimson of the Wild Cherry, the golden shades of the Black and Lombardy
Poplars, add much to the beauty of every autumn. Several of the Maples
are noteworthy in this respect, more especially the numerous varieties
of Japanese Maples (_Acer palmatum_ and _A. japonicum_), these, as well
as the Mandshurian _Acer Ginnala_, turning to various shades of red. The
Common Sycamore and Norway Maple change to yellow, but Schwedler's
variety of the latter becomes red. Other trees that deserve mention are
_Amelanchier canadensis_, whose foliage changes to lovely crimson shades
in autumn; _Koelreuteria japonica_, soft yellow; _Pyrus torminalis_,
bronzy red; _Ginkgo biloba_, pale gold; _Cladrastis tinctoria_, yellow;
_Parrotia persica_ and _Hamamelis_, bronzy red and yellow. The Common
Beech is nearly always beautiful, changing first to yellow, then to warm
brown tints. _Clerodendron trichotomum_ is a small growing tree that
should have a place wherever beautiful autumn foliage is desired. Among
Conifers the yellow-leaved variety (_aurea_) of the Scotch Pine is
remarkable in retaining its colour during the winter months only,
becoming green in spring and summer. _Retinospora squarrosa_ and
_Cryptomeria elegans_ turn bronzy red in winter. The warm red-brown
tints of the deciduous Cypress are charming.


SHRUBS

The Sumachs (_Rhus_) furnish some of the most striking of
autumn-colouring shrubs; the best of them, _R. cotinoides_, has been
already described; other fine species are _R. typhina_, _R. glabra_
(with the cut-leaved variety _laciniata_), and _R. Toxicodendron_, all
of which turn red. The Venetian Sumach, _R. Cotinus_, becomes yellow.
_Berberis Thunbergi_, which dies off a rich scarlet, is so beautiful in
autumn that on some estates it has been planted in great quantity, not
only for cover, but so that sportsmen may enjoy its colour during the
shooting season. _B. concinna_ is another charming autumn-coloured
leaved shrub of dwarf growth. _Gaultheria procumbens_ (Partridge Berry)
is too valuable to pass unnoticed. In winter its leaves are stained with
crimson. The leaves of _Cotoneaster horizontalis_ turn from green to
rich shades of chocolate or crimson. The shrub is of spreading growth.
Its evergreen ally, _B. Aquifolium_, turns a glowing red or purple after
the first frosts. The Ghent Azaleas almost always colour richly, either
deep glowing crimson, bronzy red, or gold; and of other ericaceous
plants the warm tints of _Pieris mariana_ and the rich crimson of the
_Enkianthus_ should be mentioned. The taller American _Vacciniums_
(_corymbosum_ and its various forms) are always lovely. Our native
Guelder Rose (_Viburnum Opulus_) becomes crimson in autumn, whilst the
Common Hazel and _Rhamnus Frangula_ often produce fine effects in
yellow. The feathery foliage of _Spiræa Thunbergi_ is singularly
beautiful when it changes from its natural pale green to crimson; and
_S. prunifolia fl. pl._ is perhaps more distinct than the species, and
two other Japanese shrubs (both, unfortunately, very rare) are
remarkable for their autumnal beauty. These are _Disanthus
cercidifolia_, an ally of the Witch Hazels, lovely claret colour, and
_Viburnum alnifolium_, crimson.

Other noteworthy shrubs are _Fothergilla alnifolia_, rich red; _Euonymus
alatus_, crimson; _Deutzia crenata_, yellow; and _Pyrus arbutifolia_,
red. The common Brambles of our woods should not be passed over without
mention; they turn a rich glowing red, and for their autumnal beauty
alone may be used as undergrowth in wilder parts of the garden and
woodland.


CLIMBERS

First among these, of course, is Veitch's Ampelopsis, the finest of all
deciduous climbers for walls, being self-supporting and changing to
crimson in autumn. _Vitis Coignetiæ_ is one of the noblest of all Vines,
and turns crimson also. Other Vines useful in this respect are the
Teinturier Vine, purple; _V. Romaneti_, red; and the Virginian Creeper,
especially that variety known as _muralis_ or _Engelmannii_, which
clings to walls or tree trunks without any artificial support, and
acquires beautiful red shades in autumn. Among Honeysuckles, _Lonicera
japonica var. flexuosa_ is noteworthy for the fine red purple of its
decaying leaves. Those of _Akebia quinata_ change colour in autumn and
assume shades of brownish purple, sometimes touched with maroon. Then
there is _Actinidia Kolomikta_, an Asiatic species with showy
yellow-coloured leaves in autumn. Of the Ivies _Hedera Helix
atropurpurea_ is much the best. It has medium-sized leaves which are
rich green during the growing season, but change in winter to purple and
maroon.




CHAPTER XI

TREES AND SHRUBS WITH FINE FRUITS


The most important of all the groups of trees and shrubs, for their
fruit, is the one comprising the hardy species of the Rose order. This
includes, of course, besides the Roses, such trees and shrubs as the
Thorns, Crabs, and Cotoneasters. Among the Thorns (Cratægus) are many
very handsome sorts giving variety in size and colour of the fruits. It
is unfortunate that many of them fall early and get spoilt by birds. At
the same time birds add so greatly to the delight of the garden that we
may well overlook their depredations. By many, indeed, these fruiting
trees will be considered worth growing for the encouragement they give
to bird-life. It may be well to remind planters that a considerable
number of these fruiting trees and shrubs bear male flowers on one
plant, female on another. People are often at a loss to understand why
their Sea Buckthorns or Aucubas or Skimmias do not fruit, when the
simple reason is that the plants are all male (or pollen-bearing), or
that the female ones have no males to fertilise them. As a general rule,
if these shrubs are grouped, one male to eight or ten females is a
proper proportion. As plants raised from seeds come in about equal
proportions of both sexes, it is necessary to select the females and
keep just sufficient males to pollenise them, in order that the full
beauty of the species as a fruit-bearer may be obtained. With Skimmias
and Aucubas the proper proportions can be obtained by means of cuttings.

The following hardy trees and shrubs are the most conspicuous for the
beauty of their fruits:--

ARBUTUS UNEDO.--A native of Western Ireland, has strawberry-like fruits
of a bright-scarlet colour.

AILANTUS GLANDULOSA, a fine tree over 50 feet high, is very beautiful
when covered with its red and yellow-winged fruits; there are male and
female plants.

AUCUBAS, grown at first for their ornamental foliage merely, have
latterly come into prominence as fruit-bearers; the female plants bear
clusters of bright-red berries which remain long on the branches and are
very attractive in winter.

BERBERIS.--The fruits of the Berberries are mostly covered with a
plum-coloured bloom as in _B. Aquifolium_ and _B. Darwinii_, but none of
them is handsomer than our native _B. vulgaris_ and its varieties. These
have pendent racemes of fruits, varying in colour from the typical
orange scarlet to white, purple, and black. _B. Thunbergi_ coral-red,
very beautiful.

CRATÆGUS.--The finest of all the Thorns is _C. Pyracantha_, well named
by the French "Buisson ardent." This shrub or small tree is valuable as
a graceful evergreen, and when clothed (as it nearly always is in
autumn) with its brilliant clusters of orange-red haws, it is one of the
most beautiful objects in the garden. It is quite hardy in the open, but
bears fruits more abundantly when planted against a wall. In that
position also it is more easily protected from birds, which soon destroy
the beauty of plants in the open. The variety _Lælandi_ is distinct from
the type, but hardier, and bears bright berries in abundance. The
Cockspur Thorn (_C. Crus-Galli_) has several varieties, all producing
pendent clusters of scarlet haws. The varieties like _pyracanthifolia_,
with narrow leaves and flat-topped habit, are the best in this respect;
they retain the fruits well into the winter, and are not eaten by birds
so freely as many are. The haws of _C. cordata_, the Washington Thorn,
are small, but a brilliant orange. _C. punctata_, _C. Azarolus_, and _C.
pinnatifida_ have the largest haws of any, and they are of a deep red,
but fall early; the two first, however, are variable, and forms with
yellow and other coloured haws belong to them. Those of _C. macracantha_
are bright red, and in favourable years are so plentiful as to make the
tree wondrously beautiful. _C. coccinea_ and _C. mollis_ have also red
haws, larger than those of _C. macracantha_, but they fall soon after
they are ripe. The Common Hawthorn is pretty, but more noteworthy is its
variety _aurea_, with bright-yellow haws. In _C. oliveriana_ they are
black. The Tansy-leaved Thorn (_C. tanacetifolia_) has large yellow
fruits, not badly flavoured, and with the fragrance of Apples. _C.
orientalis_ has haws of a bright sealing-wax red, but in its variety
_sanguinea_ they are of a deeper shade.

[Illustration: _BABYLONIAN WILLOW BY WATERSIDE (Kew)._]

COTONEASTERS.--Not enough use is made of Cotoneasters in gardens. They
grow well in almost any soil, and are all marked by elegant or neat
habit. They are very pretty when in flower, but it is in autumn, when
laden with fruits, that they attain their greatest beauty. One of the
tallest of them is _C. frigida_, and this bears a great abundance of
rich scarlet-red berries in flat clusters. In the nearly allied _C.
bacillaris_ they are almost black. _C. rotundifolia_ is a dwarfer shrub,
but the finest of all the Cotoneasters for its fruit; it grows about 4
feet high, and has small, very dark green, persistent leaves; the fruits
are about the size and shape of the haws of the Common Hawthorn, and are
brilliant scarlet red; they are ripe in October, and from then till
March make one of the most beautiful of winter pictures. In _C.
buxifolia_ the fruit is very abundant, but the red colour is not so
bright as in the preceding. _C. horizontalis_, now getting to be a
well-known shrub, has very pretty, globose, bright-red fruits, small but
freely borne. _C. Simonsii_, of medium height, has brilliant red
berries, as has _C. acuminata_, a near ally, but taller. The dwarfest
section of Cotoneaster, viz., _thymifolia_, _microphylla_ and its
variety _glacialis_ (or _congesta_), which are so useful for rockeries,
have all scarlet berries.

CELASTRUS ARTICULATUS is a vigorous climber from Eastern Asia,
remarkable for the great beauty of its fruits, which are golden yellow
within, and when ripe split open and reveal the shining
scarlet-coated seeds. _C. scandens_ has orange-coloured seeds.

CORIARIA JAPONICA is very beautiful in autumn, when it succeeds as well
as it does with Canon Ellacombe at Bitton, the fruits being covered then
with the persistent petals which are of a lovely coral red.

[Illustration: _WEEPING ASH; PALACE GARDENS, DALKEITH._]

CORNUS CAPITATA (_Benthamia fragifera_) only succeeds to perfection in
the south-western counties; its strawberry-like red fruits are very
handsome.

COPROSMA ACEROSA is a dwarf New Zealand shrub suitable for the rockery;
it has variously-shaded, transparent, blue-green berries.

ELÆAGNUS MULTIFLORA (or _E. longipes_) is the most ornamental in the
genus with regard to its fruits. They are remarkably abundant,
orange-coloured, and specked with reddish scales.

EUONYMUS EUROPÆUS, our native "Spindle tree," is most beautiful in
autumn, when, after a favourable season, it is covered with its open red
fruits revealing the orange-coloured seeds within.

FRAXINUS MARIESII is one of Messrs. Veitch's introductions from Japan,
and is a dwarf tree, one of the "Manna" Ashes; the thin keys are of a
bronzy-red colour and pretty.

GLEDITSCHIA TRIACANTHOS is the "Honey Locust." The pods are not brightly
coloured, being at first green, then brown, but they are long, thin, and
wavy, like crooked scimitars, and hanging in numbers on the tree; have a
very curious and (in this country) uncommon aspect.

HEDERA (Ivy).--Some of the "tree" forms of Ivy produce berries freely;
the most ornamental of them are the red, yellow, and orange-coloured
varieties of _H. Helix arborescens_.

HYMENANTHERA CRASSIFOLIA, from New Zealand, is a dense-growing,
stiff-branched, dwarf shrub, chiefly noteworthy for the white berries it
bears.

HYPERICUMS.--_H. Androsæmum_ and _H. elatum_ produce rather handsome
clusters of black fruits.

HIPPOPHAË RHAMNOIDES, the Sea Buckthorn, is one of the most brilliantly
coloured of all berry-bearing shrubs. It produces them in marvellous
profusion, and they are bright-orange coloured. Birds do not molest the
berries, and unless caught by severe frosts (which turn them grey) they
lighten the garden wonderfully up to, and sometimes after, the New Year.
The necessity of growing both sexes of plants has already been noted,
but isolated females may be artificially impregnated by shaking pollen
over them when in flower.

[Illustration: _WEEPING ASPEN IN FLOWER._]

ILEX (Holly).--The berries of the Holly are so well known that we need
only mention the yellow-berried one (_fructu-luteo_), which is not
common, but very effective in winter.

LIGUSTRUM.--The Privets are of little consequence as fruit-bearing
shrubs, and only _L. sinense_ need be mentioned; it is frequently very
striking in early winter, being covered then with great clusters of
purple-black, shot-like berries.

LYCIUM CHINENSE.--Nearly all the Box Thorns in this country belong to
this species. As for _L. europæum_ and _L. barbarum_, the names are
very common, but the plants themselves very rare. _L. chinense_ is very
ornamental in the fall of the year, its long graceful branches being
well furnished with rich red berries. _L. rhombifolium_ is one of its
forms.

MAGNOLIA TRIPETALA is occasionally noticeable in autumn because of its
large upright fruits of a reddish-purple colour.

MACLURA AURANTIACA, the "Osage Orange," bears a remarkable
orange-coloured fruit 2 to 3 inches in diameter. The tree is quite
hardy, but we have not heard of its bearing fruit in this country. This
is perhaps because male and female flowers occur on different plants.

PERNETTYA MUCRONATA.--First among ericaceous plants for beauty in fruit
is this Magellanic plant and its varieties. It is dwarf and bushy, with
small white flowers followed by enormous quantities of berries about the
size of peas. These vary in colour from white to deep crimson, and are
undoubtedly some of the most valuable of all hardy berry-bearing shrubs.
The varieties are very beautiful.

[Illustration: _WEEPING ELM ON LAWN._]

PALIURUS AUSTRALIS (Christ's Thorn) has flat, disk-like fruits, freely
borne in suitable years; they are green, and if not particularly
ornamental, are very quaint and interesting.

PTELEA TRIFOLIATA.--The same may be said of the abundant clusters of
hop-like fruits seen in this tree.

PYRUS.--In this genus, which includes the Mountain Ash, the Crabs, and
the White Beam trees, there is a great wealth of beautiful fruiting
trees. The Mountain Ash or Rowan tree (_P. Aucuparia_), when laden with
its hanging corymbs of rich scarlet berries is a delightful picture, and
it reaches its full beauty in August. Not so well known is the variety
_fructu-luteo_, with yellow fruits. A near relative of the Rowan tree is
_P. americana_, its New World representative, but it is not so
beautiful. The fruit is almost identical, but the tree is of a stiff and
less graceful aspect. The new _P. thianschanica_, which also belongs to
the Rowan tree group, has bright-red, globose berries. Perhaps of all
the genus Pyrus, none on the whole are so beautiful in autumn as the
Crabs. _P. baccata_, the Siberian Crab, with its bright-red, cherry-like
fruits, and _P. Ringo_ from Japan, with bright-yellow ones, are the best
of the true species. The hybrid "John Downie" Crab is also very
beautiful in autumn.

The flowering QUINCES are not particularly attractive in regard to the
colour of their fruits, but some of them--notably those of the dwarf
_Pyrus Maulei_--are very sweetly scented.

Some very handsome fruits are borne by the various White Beam trees
(_Pyrus Aria_ and its allies). Perhaps the best of them is _P. lanata_
(or _Sorbus majestica_), which has flat clusters of bright-red berries.
But many of the varieties of _P. Aria_ itself are very attractive. One
of the latest additions to this group is _P. alnifolia_, a neat-habited
small tree from Japan and China. It has oblong coral-red fruits.

ROSA.--Beauty at fruiting time is an almost proverbial attribute of the
Roses. None is more beautiful than our native Dog Rose (_R. canina_).
Though in many an English hedgerow, an out-of-the-way corner in many a
garden might be given up to the Dog Rose and its varieties for the sake
of their wealth of scarlet hips in autumn. _R. tomentosa_ and _R.
mollis_ are other red-fruited natives of Britain. All the members of the
Scotch Rose group (_pimpinellifolia_) have black fruits. Of exotic
species, one of the most valuable is _R. rugosa_; its flat,
orange-shaped hips are so abundant and brightly coloured that they make
a brilliant picture. _R. microphylla_ has yellow prickly fruits, whilst
those of _R. macrophylla_ are pear-shaped and scarlet. The deep-crimson
hips of _R. pomifera_, covered with bristly hairs like large
gooseberries, are as remarkable as any. Some of the American species,
although the fruits are usually small, are handsome, such as _R.
nutkana_ and _R. Carolina_. The elongated, pear-shaped fruits of _R.
alpina_ and its variety _pyrenaica_ are bright red, and have a pleasant,
resinous odour when rubbed.

RAPHIOLEPIS JAPONICA, with its clusters of small, round black berries,
should be planted at least against a wall; it is a rather slow-growing
evergreen shrub with strawberry-like flowers.

RHAPHITHAMNUS CYANOCARPUS can only be grown outside against a wall, or
in Cornwall or similar localities, but where it will succeed it is well
worth growing, not only for its pale-blue flowers, but for the
bright-blue fruits that follow them.

Some of the RHAMNUS, such as the native _R. catharticus_ and _R.
Frangula_, bear abundant crops of purple-black berries.

The dense pyramidal fruit-clusters of the Stag's-horn Sumach (_Rhus
typhina_) are often attractive, being covered with crimson hairs. Those
of _R. glabra_ are similarly coloured.

RUBUS PHOENICOLASIUS has spread in cultivation recently, and has
beautiful scarlet berries. It is hardy enough, but birds are so
attracted by the bright colour, that it requires protection from them
when in fruit.

SAMBUCUS.--The scarlet-berried Elder, _S. racemosus_, is by far the
handsomest of the genus, but although it flowers freely enough, it is
very uncertain in producing its fruits. _S. glauca_, from the West
United States, produces large, flat clusters of blue-white berries, and
there is a striking white-fruited variety of _S. nigra_ called
_leucocarpa_.

THE SNOWBERRY (_Symphoricarpus racemosus_) should always have a place in
the garden for the sake of its clusters of large pure white berries,
which remain long on the plants.

VIBURNUM.--There are several very handsome fruiting species in this
genus, no finer, however, than the native _V. Opulus_, or Guelder Rose,
with red fruits, and its variety _fructu-luteo_ with yellow ones. In the
other native species, _V. Lantana_, they are at first red, ultimately
black. Several of the Viburnums are noteworthy for the blue or
blue-black fruits; of these are _dentatum_, _molle_, _cassinoides_, and
_nudum_. Those of the evergreen _V. Tinus_ are also dark blue, but, as
with the other blue-fruited species, they are not frequently borne in
profusion in the average climate of Britain.

VITIS HETEROPHYLLA and its variety _humulifolia_, bear singularly
beautiful clusters of pale china-blue berries. To induce them to fruit
freely, however, the plants require a warm, sunny wall, and rather
restricted root-room.




CHAPTER XII

WEEPING TREES AND THEIR USES


It is not at all easy to define special uses for trees of weeping habit,
but it is safe to use them nearly singly and not in immediate connection
with trees of quite upright form. The point in the weeping tree is a
certain grace of drooping line, such as one enjoys in the drooping
racemes of many of the papilionaceous flowers such as Wistaria,
Laburnum, and Robinia. Nothing is gained by accentuating the peculiarity
by a direct association with trees of an opposite way of growth. It is
better rather to place the weeping trees near rounded masses of shrub
and small tree--for example, a Weeping Birch would group well with a
clump of Rhododendrons.

Near water weeping trees seem to be specially effective. An instance of
this is shown in the familiar Weeping Willow, but one at a time seems as
much as is wanted.

As a general rule, we strongly advocate planting in groups, whether in
the case of trees, shrubs, or flowering plants, but the weeping trees
are less suited for grouping than any others. One Weeping Willow is all
very well, but a whole grove of them would be monotonous and tiresome.

[Illustration: _ELÆAGNUS PUNGENS (Kew)._]

The habit of some of the weeping trees can be directly turned to
account in the making of arbours and pergolas; for by planting the
large-leaved Weeping Elm or the Weeping Ash at the back and on each side
in the case of an arbour, or alternately on each side of the walk for a
pergola, a living shelter may be made in a very few years. The trees in
this case are standards pollarded at about 8 feet from the ground, the
form in which they are generally sent out from the nursery.

[Illustration: _CORNUS MAS VAR. VARIEGATA (Variegated Cornel)._]

Among evergreens the Holly is invaluable. As a rule the weeping or
pendulous varieties are budded on tall stems of the type, and trained
out in an umbrella-like fashion, thus forming a hollow mound of
greenery. In some places, notably at Brookwood in Surrey, pendulous
Hollies have been allowed to grow without any attempt at training. Stout
stems 10 feet to 12 feet high are surmounted by irregular heads, which
droop down 6 feet or 7 feet, leaving several feet at the base of the
stem bare. In winter the long pendulous branches, smothered with bright
red berries, are very pleasant. Facing page 248 is an illustration of a
weeping Holly (_I. Aquifolium var. pendula_) at Kew. Of variegated
weeping Hollies there are _Argentea pendula_ (Perry's Weeping), with
silver variegated leaves; _aurea pendula_ (Waterer's Weeping), with gold
variegated leaves; and _pendula tricolor_. To encourage height rather
than width, it is often necessary to tie up a few of the top shoots,
otherwise they get out of shape; they increase more quickly in width
than height.

CHAPTER XIII

THE USE OF VARIEGATED TREES AND SHRUBS


The best use of trees and shrubs with coloured or variegated foliage is
not very easy to determine, though it may be possible to give a few
useful suggestions. The usual way of planting them here and there among
mixed masses of evergreen and deciduous growths is perhaps the worst way
of all. All good planting must be done with much thought and care, and
these plants of coloured foliage, that are necessarily more conspicuous
than others, want the most careful placing of any.

One excellent use of evergreen trees and shrubs with golden colouring,
such as the Gold Hollies, Cypresses, Yews, and Privets is to make them
into a cheerful bit of outdoor winter garden. The Gold-leaved Privet is
a delightful thing in early winter, and though Wild Privet, untouched by
the knife, is a deciduous shrub, the clipped Privets of our gardens
usually hold their leaves throughout the winter. With these the
variegated Japan Honeysuckle might be freely used, much of its yellow
veining turning to a bright red in winter. _Cassinia fulvida_ is another
good winter shrub with its tiny gold-backed leaves. The pretty bushes of
this neat New Zealander are apt to grow somewhat straggling, but the
crowded little branches are the very thing that is wanted through the
winter as cut greenery to go with winter flowers, whether hardy or from
under glass. If these are cut a foot long the bush is kept in shape, and
a valuable supply of stuff for house decoration is provided.

A half or even quarter acre of well-arranged planting of these
gold-variegated shrubs has a surprisingly cheery effect in winter,
making a kind of sunlight of its own when skies are grey, and a
comfortable shelter when winds are keen.

In summer, too, it will be beautiful if the spaces between the shrubs
are cleverly planted, for preference, with plants of white or
pale-yellow flowers, such as White Foxglove, _Oenothera lamarckiana_,
white and pale-yellow _Hibiscus ficifolius_, _Liliums auratum_,
_giganteum_, _speciosum_, and _longifolium_; White Everlasting Pea
trained loosely through any near branches; _Nicotiana affinis_ and _N.
sylvestris_; and close to the path hardy Ferns of pale-green frondage,
such as the Lady Fern; with clumps of plants of golden foliage like the
Gold Valerian and Gold Nettle. A shrub of variegated foliage, planted
without special attention, and coming suddenly in a grouping of others
of an average green colour is made unduly conspicuous. It should be led
up to by neighbours whose colouring gradually assimilates with its own.
The sudden effect of colouring is all very well in the nurseryman's show
borders, where the object is to attract attention to showy individuals,
but in our gardens we want the effect of well-arranged pictures
rather than that of shop windows.

[Illustration: _TAURIAN TAMARISK (Tamarix tetrandra), IN FLOWER._]

A variegated plant to be of real value in the garden must have clear,
bright, and abundant red and yellow or white markings, not dotted or
merely margined with colour. So many worthless shrubs with poor
variegation have been named and offered for sale that it is unwise to
buy them from a catalogue. We may repeat the advice already given, which
is to see them first.

Trees and shrubs with coloured foliage are of several kinds. Most common
of all are those which have leaves blotched or edged with golden or
creamy yellow and white, such as the variegated Hollies and Elæagnuses.
Then there are those which are only coloured at a certain season, like
_Neillia opulifolia aurea_. This has leaves of a beautiful self yellow
colour when they unfold in spring, but become green as the summer
advances; or the variegated Plane (_Platanus acerifolia Süttneri_),
which is only variegated in late summer and autumn.

Finally, there are those, like the Purple Hazel or Purple Beech, which
have leaves of one colour and remain almost of the same shade whilst
they are on the tree.

On the whole the plants that retain their colour till late summer and
autumn, or acquire it then, are most valuable, because very few trees
and shrubs are then in flower.

Variegated trees and shrubs must not be planted too plentifully, and
studiously avoid all spotty effects. Many a garden would be improved by
bringing the variegated shrubs it contains together so as to produce a
few broad masses of colour. Some of these shrubs, like Spath's Cornel,
or the Golden Elder, may, in large gardens especially, be planted alone
in large beds or groups. The large trees, like the Purple Beech, can
stand by themselves.

The following list contains about one hundred of the finest of
variegated trees and shrubs:--


TREES

Acer Negundo variegatum, creamy white.
 ,,  Negundo aureum, golden entirely.
 ,,  platanoides Schwedleri, soft red in spring.
 ,,  Pseudo-platanus flavo-marginatum, the "Corstorphine" Sycamore, one
       of the largest of variegated trees.
Alnus glutinosa aurea, wholly yellow.
Betula alba purpurea, wholly purple.
Castanea sativa aureo-marginata, the variegated Sweet Chestnut, perhaps
  the best of all large trees, with parti-coloured leaves. The leaves
  burn on some soils.
Catalpa bignonioides aurea, wholly golden, and most effective in summer
  and autumn.
Fagus sylvatica purpurea. Of the Purple Beeches there are now numerous
        forms, such as atropurpurea, cuprea, purpurea, pendula
        (weeping), and "Swat Magret" (the darkest of all). Pyramidalis
        purpurea is very beautiful.
 ,,   sylvatica variegata, white.
 ,,   sylvatica tricolor, various shades of red and purple; beautifully
        coloured, but not vigorous.
 ,,   sylvatica var. Zlatia, entirely pale golden green in spring, but
        for a short time only.
 ,,   sylvatica, Paul's gold-margined, is a pretty variegated tree.
Fraxinus americana aucubæfolia, richly mottled with yellow.
Ilex Aquifolium. The variegated Hollies, both silver and golden, are now
  very numerous; among the best are argentea marginata, argentea pendula
  (Perry's Silver Weeping), Golden Queen, Silver Queen, Handsworth
  Silver, Golden King, flavescens, latifolia aureo-marginata,
  Watereriana, aureo-medio picta, aureo-pendula.
Laburnum vulgare foliis aureis, all yellow.
Platanus acerifolia Süttneri, very pure white with scarcely any green on
  late growth.
Populus deltoidea (canadensis) aurea, yellow.
Prunus cerasifera atropurpurea (P. Pissardi), lovely claret red when
  young, becoming dull purple in summer.
Pyrus Malus neidwetzkyanus. In this Apple not only the leaves, but the
        wood and fruit are purplish red.
 ,,   Aria chrysophylla, yellow.
Quercus Cerris variegata, the white variegated Turkey Oak.
  ,,    pedunculata Concordia, a lovely clear yellow, and seldom burns.
  ,,    pedunculata purpurea, wholly red purple.
  ,,    rubra, crimson.
Robinia Pseudacacia aurea, yellow.
Ulmus campestris, "Louis Van Houtte," the best Golden Elm.
 ,,   campestris viminalis variegata, a charming white-variegated,
        small-leaved Elm.
 ,,   montana fastigiata aurea (U. Wredei aurea) should not be omitted.
        A beautiful Elm for small gardens.

[Illustration: _ASHES_]


CONIFERS

Abies concolor violacea, glaucous blue.
Cedrus atlantica glauca, glaucous blue.
Cupressus lawsoniana; numerous varieties, of which gracilis pendula
            aurea, lutea (very hardy), Silver Queen, and albo-variegata
            may be mentioned.
   ,,     nootkatensis lutea, yellow-tipped twigs.
   ,,     obtusa aurea (Thujopsis borealis aurea), yellow.
   ,,     obtusa nana aurea, dwarf yellow.
   ,,     pisifera plumosa aurea, yellow.
   ,,     macrocarpa lutea, the best yellow Conifer in mild districts.
Juniperus chinensis aurea, gold-tipped.
Picea orientalis argenteo-spica, young shoots pale yellow.
 ,,   pungens glauca, the best "blue" Conifer.
Pinus sylvestris aurea, golden in winter, green in spring and summer.
Retinospora (_see_ Cupressus).
Taxus baccata aurea, "Golden Yew," _elegantissima_ and Golden
        Irish. I was very pleased with the beautiful colouring of
        natural golden hybrid forms in Messrs. Fisher, Son, & Sibray's
        nursery at Handsworth. T. adpressa, Barroni, a. variegata,
        small-growing, leaves edged with silver, and suffused with
        yellow as winter approaches.
 ,,   baccata fastigiata aurea, "Golden Irish Yew."
 ,,   baccata semper-aurea, golden more or less throughout the winter.
 ,,   Dovastoni aureo-variegata.
Thujopsis (_see_ Cupressus, p. 97).
Thuya (Biota) orientalis aurea, yellow in summer.

[Illustration: _THE LOMBARDY POPLAR._]

Cornus alba Spaethii, probably the finest of all yellow-variegated
  shrubs, never "scorching" in the hottest summers. It is very
  handsome as pyramids, but by pruning a brighter coloured bark is
  obtained.
Euonymus radicans, the white-variegated form of this plant is useful as
  a carpet in shady positions where grass will not grow.
Ivy (Hedera Helix), numerous varieties, both shrubby and
  climbing--arborescens variegata, chrysophylla, discolor, maderensis
  variegata, sulphurea, canariensis argentea. E. radicans Silver gem is
  a larger leaved form, purer white and altogether better than many
  variegated Ivies.
Jasminum nudiflorum foliis aureis and officinale foliis aureis,
  variegated climbers with yellow leaves; the latter is the more
  ornamental, but is delicate in constitution.
Kerria japonica foliis variegatis, white.
Lonicera japonica aureo-reticulata. The veins of this climber are
  beautifully "picked out" in gold.
Osmanthus Aquifolium ilicifolius variegatus, a holly-like,
  white-variegated shrub useful in the milder parts of the kingdom.
Osmanthus Aquifolium purpureus, the hardiest of the Osmanthus. There
  are two forms of this, one much darker than the other, and the darkest
  is the best.
Pieris japonica variegata, white.
Ribes alpinum pumilum aureum, golden in spring.
Rubus ulmifolius variegatus, veins of the later leaves golden.
Salix repens argentea, a prostrate silvery-leaved Willow, makes a pretty
  weeping shrub if trained up at first.
Santolina Chamæcyparissus, silvery white entirely.
Vitis heterophylla variegata, a pretty, blue-berried climber, but
        tender; the variegation is rosy white.
 ,,   inconstans purpurea, a purplish form of the popular "Ampelopsis
        Veitchii."
 ,,   vinifera purpurea, deep purple.
Vinca minor, white and yellow-marked forms.

CHAPTER XIV

TREES AND SHRUBS FOR SEA-COAST


In planting trees and shrubs near the sea, two important matters must be
considered--(1) fierce gales; (2) salt spray. As a protection against
storms much may be done by planting quick-growing things, such as
Poplars and Willows, and in this sheltered area more permanent trees and
shrubs may be put. This way of planting for shelter where bleak places
are to be clothed with trees and shrubs is universally adopted in some
form or other, sometimes in the shape of hedges or belts, and in the
other cases the plants are all placed much thicker together than they
are to permanently remain, thus forming a compact mass against which the
wind makes little or no impression. In this last-named case continual
thinning will be necessary as they grow up, for if left too long the
plants become weak, and the advantage gained by the thicker planting is
then completely lost. A beautiful seaside shrub, and the best, too, for
forming shelter hedges of low or medium height is the Tamarisk, which
retains its freshness throughout the season till the autumn, however
much exposed to the sea.

It is difficult to make a list of trees and shrubs suitable for seaside
planting around the British Isles, as the coast-line is so varied, and
the action of the Gulf Stream has great influence on the vegetation of
many parts of our western coasts. As no hard and fast line can be drawn,
the first list contains those trees and shrubs that may be regarded as
thoroughly hardy, unless otherwise specified, and the second list those
that are available for planting in the Isle of Wight, in the south and
west of England, and in some parts of Ireland.

CHAPTER XV

TREES AND SHRUBS FOR WIND-SWEPT GARDENS


Few trees and shrubs are happy in bleak and exposed gardens. The
hardiest should be used to form a shelter belt, as every leaf and twig
helps to break the force of the wind, whereas solid obstacles, such as
walls, merely serve to divert its course. In planting spots much exposed
to the wind, put the trees much closer than it is intended they should
remain permanently, as the young plants serve to shelter one another,
and encourage, therefore, a quicker growth. When they get crowded,
gradually thin them out. The trees and shrubs should always come from
exposed nurseries, as the growth is stout and sturdy. Growth made in
warm valleys is more sappy. The following trees and shrubs can be
depended upon in most windy places:--


TREES

Acer platanoides (Norway Maple) and Acer Pseudo-platanus (Sycamore).
    While not equal to some of the trees mentioned, these Maples do
    well in many places and form a distinct feature.

Betula alba (Common Birch). An extremely graceful tree and a universal
    favourite.

Cratægus Oxyacantha (Hawthorn). The principal effect of exposure is
    to make the growth more stunted than would otherwise be the case.

Fagus sylvatica (Beech). Long recognised as a good shelter tree, its
    value in this respect is increased by the fact that many leaves
    often shrivel on the branches instead of dropping, thus giving
    additional protection in winter.

Fraxinus Excelsior (Ash). The wide-spreading roots of this anchor it
    securely in position, and the leaves do not weigh down the branches
    to any great extent.

Ilex Aquifolium (Holly). Though of slow growth when young, this, when
    once established, grows away freely and is indifferent to wind.

Larix europæa (Larch). This is well known as a nurse tree for bleak
    places.

Picea (Abies) excelsa (Norway Spruce). One of our commonest Conifers,
    hence it is often used as a nurse tree for choicer subjects.

Pinus austriaca (Austrian Fir). The best of all evergreens for bleak
    places; Pinus Cembra (Swiss Stone Pine), of slow growth, but very
    ornamental, and does not mind the wind.

Pinus Laricio (Corsican Pine, or Black Pine). As indifferent to exposure
    as P. austriaca, P. montana (dwarf), and P. sylvestris (Scotch Fir),
    a well-known native, which often crowns high hill-tops.

Populus alba (Abele), P. fastigiata (Lombardy Poplar), P. deltoidea
    (Canadian Poplar), P. nigra (Black Poplar), and P. tremula (Aspen).
    In low-lying districts all these Poplars are of rapid growth, but in
    exposed places they make much slower progress. Even then they grow
    quicker than most shelter plants, and are valuable for making an
    effective display more quickly than some of the more permanent
    subjects. These can all be readily cut back within reasonable limits
    if desired.

Quercus Robur (Oak).

Robinia Pseudacacia. The false Acacia is one of the best town trees we
    have; indeed, it does well almost everywhere.

Salix alba (White Willow). This will pass unscathed through fierce
    storms. In fairly dry spots the rate of progress is much slower than
    in moister soil, but, as a set-off, the silvery hue of the foliage
    is more pronounced.

Ulmus (Elm). The best of the Elms for this purpose is the Wych Elm, and
    one known as the Wheatley is also good.

[Illustration: _VARIETY TENUIFOLIA OF CORSICAN PINE (Pinus Laricio)._]


SHRUBS

Atriplex Halimus (Sea Purslane). A silvery-leaved, free-growing shrub,
    indifferent to soil or situation.

Berberis (the Barberry). The best of these are the strong-growing
    Berberis aristata, and the common Berberis vulgaris, with its
    several varieties.

Colutea arborescens (Bladder Senna). The golden flowers in early summer
    and the large inflated seed-pods in autumn are both attractive.

Cotoneaster buxifolia, Nummularia, and Simonsii. These are all pretty
    berry-bearing shrubs.

Cytisus albus (White Broom), Cytisus scoparius (Yellow Broom), and its
    varieties.

Deutzia crenata flore-pleno. A handsome flowering shrub and the most
    robust of its class.

Euonymus europæus (Spindle tree). The fruits of this are very ornamental
    in the autumn.

Halimodendron argenteum (Siberian Salt Bush). A pretty rambling shrub,
    with silvery leaves.

Juniperus communis and J. Sabina (Savin). The fact that these Junipers
    are evergreen is a point in their favour.

Ligustrum ovalifolium, ovalifolium elegantissimum, and vulgare. These
    Privets are well known for planting where the conditions are none
    too favourable.

Lycium chinense (Box Thorn). A rambling shrub holding its own almost
    anywhere.

[Illustration: _AVENUE OF ABIES NOBILIS GLAUCA AT MADRESFIELD COURT._

(_The avenue is quarter-mile long, planted in 1868; average height of
trees 60 feet and 45 feet apart._)]

Osmanthus of sorts. Holly-like evergreen shrubs.

Philadelphus coronarius (Mock Orange). Though less showy than some
    others, this is decidedly the hardiest.

Phillyræa decora (vilmoriniana). A valuable evergreen with deep-green,
    leathery leaves.

Pinus (Mountain Pine). This member of the Fir family is but a shrub in
    stature. It is at home in bleak spots.

Potentilla fruticosa (Shrubby Cinquefoil). A low shrub that produces its
    golden blossoms in July and August.

Prunus Laurocerasus rotundifolia. One of the hardiest forms of the
    Common Laurel.

Rosa canina (Dog Rose) and Rosa rubiginosa (Sweetbriar) are general
    favourites.

Rubus (Bramble). The cut-leaved, the double white, and double pink are
    ornamental.

Spartium junceum (Spanish Broom). However bleak, this will produce its
    comparatively large pea-shaped blossoms throughout the summer.

Staphylea pinnata (Bladder Nut). The bladder-like seed-capsules are
    striking in the autumn.

Symphoricarpus racemosus (Snowberry). Grows anywhere, and produces its
    large white berries in great profusion.

Ulex europæa (Common Furze). The double form of this is remarkably
    showy.

Viburnum Opulus (Guelder Rose). A pretty native shrub.

trees, hence some difference in growth and colour._)]




CHAPTER XVI

CONIFERS (INCLUDING PINES) IN ORNAMENTAL PLANTING


Those who take a serious interest in their gardens and other planted
grounds are so rapidly acquiring a better comprehension of the art in
its wider aspects, and are so willingly receptive of further suggestion,
that we emphasise a lesson that we have often tried to teach, namely,
the importance of planting in large groups of one thing at a time, and
of a right choice.

There is no more common mistake made than that of planting just the
wrong things in the wrong places. Thus we see plantations of Spruce on
dry, sandy hill-tops, from whence the poor trees must look with longing
eyes to their true home in the moist, alluvial soil of the valley-bottom
below. In mixed plantations we see Conifers from many climes and all
altitudes, all expected to do equally well in perhaps one small space of
garden ground. If in a projected plantation there is space for only
fifty trees, how much better it would be first to ascertain which out of
a few kinds would be best suited to the soil and general conditions of
the place, and then out of this selection to choose the one that best
fits the planter's own liking and will be most in harmony with the
further planting scheme that he has in view. In this way he will
obtain that unity of effect that alone can make a garden or piece of
planted ground pictorial and restful, and enable to serve as a becoming
setting to the brightly-coloured flowering plants that will then show
their proper value as jewels of the garden.

[Illustration: _LIBOCEDRUS DECURRENS AT FROGMORE (about 65 feet high)._]

In this restrained and sober use of trees, and especially of Conifers,
it is well to plant them of several ages, the youngest to the outer
edges of the groups. If there is plenty of space it will be all the
better to plant the trees in hundreds rather than in fifties, or in any
case in spaces large enough to see one whole picture of one good tree at
a time. Where such a planting was wisely made from forty to sixty years
ago how fine the effect is to-day, as in the case of the grand growth of
Douglas Firs at Murthly. No one seeing so fine an example of the use of
one tree at a time could wish that the plantation had been mixed, or
could be otherwise than deeply impressed with the desirability of the
plan.

One such large group can always be made to merge into another by
intergrouping at the edges, beginning by an isolated tree of group B in
the further portion of group A, then a group of two or three of B, until
the process is reversed and the group is all of B, with single ones of A
giving place to all B. There is no reason why the same principle should
not be used with two or three kinds of combined grouping, but then it
should be of trees harmonious among themselves, as of Spruce and Silver
Fir, or of such things as represent the natural mixture of indigenous
growth. Thus the Yew, Box, Viburnum, Dogwood, Privet, and Thorn of a
wild chalky waste might be taken as a guide to planting some of these
with nearly allied foreign kinds. But the important thing in all such
planting is to have the satisfactory restfulness and beauty of harmony
that can only be obtained by the right and limited choice of material.

Although a few Conifers are deciduous, such as the Maidenhair tree
(_Ginkgo biloba_), _Taxodium distichum_, the Golden Larch (_Pseudolarix
Kæmpferi_), and the true Larches, the great bulk of the family consists
of evergreens. It is to the Coniferæ, indeed, that belong the only hardy
evergreen trees which in stature and size rival the large deciduous
trees of cool temperate latitudes. Although our only native Conifers are
the Yew, the Scotch Pine, and the Juniper, there is a sufficient variety
of soil and climate within the limits of the British Isles to provide
suitable conditions for nearly the whole of the family. It is only a few
sub-tropical species that cannot be accommodated. This does not imply
that the whole of the hardy Conifers can be grown satisfactorily in any
one place. In even the best Conifer localities there are some species
that will not reach perfection, and in the general run of gardens there
is a considerable proportion of species about which the same must be
said. This fact, however, has often been overlooked.

The extreme popularity of Conifers, which was at its height from forty
to fifty years ago, undoubtedly led to the enriching of the parks and
gardens of this country with what are now, in many instances,
magnificent specimens. To realise how great that enrichment was, one has
only to mention such places as Dropmore, Murthly Castle, Ochtertyre. But
Conifer planting, from both artistic and merely cultural points of view,
was overdone. Conifers began to fill an undue proportion of space in
gardens, and displaced to a large extent the beautiful flower-bearing
deciduous vegetation whose seasonable variations give such charm and
interest. With all their symmetry and richness of hue, the popular
species of Abies and Picea often have a heavy, even sombre, aspect.
Heavy masses of Pine, Spruce, and Fir can never give that changing
aspect in the landscape that comes with deciduous vegetation. The tender
tints of spring, the flowers, the gold and purple of autumn, it is to
these that the seasons of our northern latitudes owe their greatest
delights.

Perhaps the worst of all the uses to which Conifers have been put is
that of forming long avenues across parks. It is difficult to understand
the frame of mind that would prefer rows of _Araucaria_, _Abies
nobilis_, or other similar things--however well grown and pyramidal they
might be--to a noble vista of Chestnut, Oak, or Lime, with its canopy of
branch and foliage overhead. Conifers can, however, be used effectively
for forming short avenues within the garden itself, especially in the
more trimly-kept parts.

The practice that is frequently adopted of forming a pinetum and
bringing together the members of this family in one part of the grounds
is a very good one. It is far better than sprinkling them
indiscriminately over the whole garden. At the same time, where
sufficient space is not available for the formation of a pinetum they
may be used in their proper proportion with other evergreens in various
parts of the garden. Single specimens on lawns of Abies, Picea, and of
many other genera are always effective, and nothing in the whole range
of native or foreign trees is more stately and picturesque than the
Cedar of Lebanon. How much do we of the present day owe to those who a
century or more ago planted this tree so abundantly in this country!

Before planting Conifers largely in any garden where they are to be
grown for their purely ornamental qualities, a study should be made of
the species planted in other gardens where the conditions as to soil,
moisture, and altitude are similar. On the peaty formations in Surrey
and Hampshire where Rhododendrons succeed so well, many Conifers thrive
exceedingly well also. The Common Spruce and its allies are nearly all
failures on light dry soil, especially where the subsoil is gravel. In
places, however, where the Spruces fail, the Common Larch and the Lawson
Cypress succeed well. In chalk districts many Conifers refuse to grow,
but the following are among those that thrive: _Abies magnifica_, _A.
nobilis_, _A. nordmanniana_, and _A. Pinsapo_, the Cedars, _Cupressus
lawsoniana_, _C. macrocarpa_, and _C. nootkatensis_, the Maidenhair
tree, the Junipers, the Thuyas, the Yews, and the following Pines:
_Pinus Laricio_ and _P. austriaca_, the Scotch Pine, _P. excelsa_, and
_P. Pinaster_. Most of the Pines, too, are happy on gravelly or stony
ground.

None of the Silver Firs (_Abies_) or Spruces (_Picea_) are good trees
for planting at the seaside, unless there is sufficient shelter to break
the force of the wind, and even then there are very few that will
succeed. The species most suitable for planting where there is a thick
outer belt are _Abies nobilis_, _A. concolor_, _A. nordmanniana_, and
_A. pectinata_, the Common Silver Fir. Of the Spruces, _Picea nigra_ and
_P. alba_, the North American Spruces, succeed better than the Norway
Spruce, _P. excelsa_, but these, like the Silver Firs, must have the
shelter of a good wind break; _Picea pungens_, _P. pungens glauca_, and
_P. Engelmanni_ will not succeed in exposed places, even in inland
localities, and fail entirely by the sea. There is a difference of
opinion about _Engelmanni_. In some places it seems to stand winds well.
The Conifers that will thrive by the sea are very few, and probably not
more than half-a-dozen kinds can be trusted. The finest of all is
undoubtedly _Pinus Pinaster_, which is essentially a sea-coast Pine,
revelling in storms and sprays. For warmer parts, is the Aleppo Pine
(_P. halepensis_), but is only for southern and warm coasts. _P.
insignis_ is somewhat tender, but stands the sea gales fairly well, and
_P. austriaca_, and its relative, _P. Laricio_, are both excellent,
specially for making the first barrier against the winds. The hardy
Scotch Pine (_P. sylvestris_), if planted in large masses, grows well,
but does not luxuriate close to the sea, and is especially liable to be
browned in foliage by the salt spray.

Besides the Pines, one of the finest of Conifers is the Monterey Cypress
(_Cupressus macrocarpa_), which is hardy everywhere on the coast in
these islands; it grows finer than it does in its home on the Pacific
coast. It makes a fine front barrier against the wind, especially when
mixed with the foregoing Pines. The variety _C. lambertiana_ is also
excellent. There are two other Conifers which, though not much planted
by the sea-coast, will, we believe, prove reliable; these are _Cedrus
atlantica_ and _Thuya gigantea_ (sometimes called _T. Lobbii_). A third
Conifer that we have seen doing well by the sea is _Abies Pinsapo_, but
it must have a temporary shelter in its small state. This subject of
seaside planting--the most difficult in a tree planter's practice--is an
important one, and it is only possible to treat the matter generally.

The Conifer family is especially noteworthy for the way many of its
species vary. Not only is this propensity evidenced in such characters
as the colour of the leaf and the differences in habit; it shows itself
more remarkably sometimes in the form and texture of the leaf and mode
of branching. So great is the difference between some forms of certain
species of Conifers that they have been placed in different genera. What
are generally known as Retinosporas, for instance, are really nothing
more than forms, "states" the botanists term them, assumed by various
species of Thuya and Cupressus. Strictly speaking, _Retinospora_ has no
separate existence as a genus. This, however, is a botanical phase of
the matter. Horticulturally we are more concerned with such variations
as adapt the plants to various garden purposes. Many quaint and dainty
forms of large trees are very suitable for the rock-garden in
association with other alpine plants. The Common Spruce, for instance,
has given birth to many pigmy forms. The Yew, the Scotch Pine, and
various others have "sported" in a similar way. But no hardy tree varies
so much, perhaps, as the Lawson Cypress when raised from seed. The
species has assumed almost every shade of colour that Conifers do
assume, and every form of growth. Beautiful golden, variegated,
pendulous, and erect varieties have been raised, and not only from the
Lawson Cypress, but from many other Conifers also. The Golden Yews, the
yellow form of the Monterey Cypress, and the golden variety of the
Scotch Pine, may be recommended to those who require this colour,
although in the Pine it only shows itself in winter. The blue-white or
glaucous hue that is more or less present in most Conifers, shows itself
most conspicuously in the Blue Spruce (_Picea pungens glauca_), in
_Cedrus atlantica glauca_, in the new Cork Fir from Arizona (_Abies
lasiocarpa var. arizonica_), and in _Abies concolor violacea_.


THE PROPAGATION OF CONIFERS

Many mistakes have been made in propagating the Coniferæ, and to make
matters still worse, the old erroneous doctrines are still preached and
practised. The unpopularity of certain species of Abies, Picea, and
Pinus is due to a great extent to the practice of grafting them on
unsuitable stocks. For instance, the species of Abies are worked on _A.
pectinata_, of Picea on _P. excelsa_, and of Pinus on _P. sylvestris_ or
_P. Laricio_. The varieties of _P. excelsa_ are worked on that species.
_P. excelsa_ is _not_ used for the other forms of spruce Firs to any
great extent. In addition to this, such methods and stocks are still
spoken of as the correct ones to use; though, to take one genus alone,
what kind of a specimen _Abies bracteata_, _A. nobilis_, or _A.
concolor_ would make in twenty years' time if worked on _A. pectinata_
we should not like to say--certainly very poor, even if they lived,
which is doubtful. These are nearly always raised from imported seeds.
It may be laid down as a law that _species_ of Coniferæ should never be
grafted but raised from seed, which can always be obtained through
English firms. With varietal forms of Coniferæ that will not come true
from seed or that cannot be struck as cuttings, grafting must be
resorted to, and if young plants of the type species are used as stocks
the results will be fairly satisfactory. In the case of some of the more
highly variegated Cupressus, &c., grafting is really the best method of
propagation, as these forms are mostly of weak constitution and are not
satisfactory from cuttings. In the following list the best methods of
propagation are given with each genus, together with special mention of
those forms which are of indifferent growth though not difficult to
propagate:--

JUNIPERUS.--The Junipers should be raised from seeds, though some of
them do fairly well if propagated by cuttings. The green and glaucous
varieties of _J. chinensis_, _J. excelsa_, _J. virginiana_, and _J.
communis_ root easily from cuttings, or can be layered with success. The
variegated forms are best grafted on stocks of the species they belong
to, and _J. Sabina_ (the Savin) and its varieties are easily raised from
cuttings or layers, the latter being a very easy way of propagating
them.

CUPRESSUS.--This genus is divided into two sections, viz., the true
Cypresses, represented by _C. macrocarpa_, _C. sempervirens_, &c., and
Chamæcyparis, of which _Cupressus lawsoniana_ is the best known species.
With the former section seeds are the best means of reproducing the
species, while the few varieties should be grafted on stocks of the
parent species. The handsome _C. macrocarpa var. lutea_ especially
should be worked on the type, as it is practically a failure from
cuttings, and if grafted on _C. lawsoniana_, as is sometimes done, it
makes a short, stumpy bush instead of a typically tall columnar tree. In
the Chamæcyparis section _Cupressus lawsoniana_, _C. nootkatensis_, _C.
obtusa_, _C. pisifera_, and _C. thyoides_ are the only species, though
there are a host of varieties attached to them, the forms of the three
latter species, in fact, including all the various plants more commonly
known under the generic title of Retinospora. The species should be
raised from seed, which is easily obtainable and germinates readily, or
in default they will root from cuttings. The varieties, with a few
exceptions, are quickly propagated by cuttings, those that require to be
grafted being _C. lawsoniana var. lutea_, the variegated forms of _C.
nootkatensis_, and _C. obtusa vars. nana_, _nana aurea_, and _filifera
aurea_. The forms of _C. thyoides_ also do well when raised from layers.
We must not omit also such varieties of _C. lawsoniana_ as _Fraseri_,
_Allumi_, and one known in nurseries as Milford Blue Jacket.

THUYA.--These are propagated in much the same way as the Cupressus,
viz., the species by seeds, and the varieties by cuttings or by grafting
in the case of the one or two highly variegated forms. Some of the green
or glaucous varieties of both Cupressus and Thuya will come fairly true
from seed, from 40 per cent. to 70 per cent. being the usual quantity of
seedlings true to name. Variegated forms from seed either come green or
a mongrel mixture of green and variegated.

LIBOCEDRUS.--This should be raised from seed, as when grafted on _Thuya
orientalis_--a too common method of propagation--it makes a miserable
specimen. The middle pair of scales in the cone of Libocedrus alone
contain fertile seeds. _L. doniana_ is a tender species.

SCIADOPITYS and TAXODIUM.--These can only be propagated by seeds, and
the young plants should have a fairly moist position with plenty of
leaf-mould or peat to grow in afterwards.

SEQUOIA.--The two species of Sequoia should be raised from seed, and the
three or four varieties be grafted on the type species.

CRYPTOMERIA.--This only contains one species, viz., _C. japonica_, which
can only be obtained from seed, or by cuttings; and the varieties root
readily as cuttings, though one or two of the weaklier ones do better if
grafted on _C. japonica_.

ARAUCARIA.--Propagate by seeds, which, though sometimes difficult to
obtain, germinate freely and quickly.

TSUGA.--The Hemlock Spruces are easily and quickly obtained from seeds,
and one or two will strike from cuttings; the varieties do best when
grafted on the species they belong to, though _T. pattoniana var.
glauca_, more commonly known as _Abies hookeriana_, will come fairly
true from seed, about 75 per cent. being the usual quantity if the seed
is obtained from good plants.

PICEA.--This genus has been mentioned before as being commonly grafted
on _P. excelsa_ (the Common Spruce), which is an easy way of obtaining
young plants, which, however, cannot be recommended to form good
specimens in after years. The species of Picea should all be raised from
seed, and the many named varieties of _P. excelsa_ should be grafted on
the parent species. At least one-half the plants of _P. Engelmanni var.
glauca_ and _P. pungens var. glauca_ (the Californian Blue Spruce) will
be found true to name when raised from seeds, while their superiority
afterwards over grafted plants is evident.

CEDRUS, LARIX, AND PSEUDOLARIX.--It should always be remembered that
these three are quite distinct genera, and for purposes of propagation
should never be used in conjunction with each other, the first being
evergreen and the two latter deciduous. The species of all three should
be raised from seed; the varieties of Cedrus should be grafted on that
genus, the forms of Larix on the Larch, though the geographical forms of
the Common Larch, such as _var. rossica_ and _var. sibirica_, usually
come true from seed. _Larix leptolepis_ (Japanese Larch) is one of the
most beautiful trees ever introduced from Japan; it is charming both in
summer and winter. _Pseudolarix Kæmpferi_ (Golden Larch), the only
representative of the genus, must be raised from seed; it is generally
raised by grafting in February under glass on stocks of the common
Larch.

ABIES.--In this genus some of the most handsome Conifers are found, and
also some of the most difficult to grow. All the Abies should be
propagated by seeds, but if seed of the varieties cannot be obtained
then they must be grafted on the parent species.

PSEUDOTSUGA.--This genus only contains one species, viz., _P. Douglasii_
(the Douglas Fir), which is propagated readily by seed, the seedlings
being of rapid growth and soon form good plants. The few varieties are
grafted on the type, though the majority will come fairly true from
seed, which, however, is not always to be obtained.

PINUS.--Perhaps no Conifer adds so much to the beauty of the landscape
in winter as the Pine. All the species should be raised from seeds, and
any green or glaucous varieties can also be propagated in the same way
if seeds can be obtained. The golden, dwarf, and variegated Pines must
be grafted on the species they are varieties of.

TAXACEÆ.--This group is usually associated with Coniferæ, from which it
differs chiefly by the seed being nearly or quite enclosed in a fleshy
envelope instead of in a cone, the fruit of some resembling a small
Plum, but a typical fruit is seen in that of the Common Yew. The hardy
genera are _Ginkgo biloba_ (the Maidenhair tree), which is propagated
from seed--the plant is deciduous and slow growing; Cephalotaxus and
Torreya are propagated by seeds, cuttings, or layers.

TAXUS (the Yew).--There are only three or four species of Taxus, but
there are a great many varieties of the Common Yew, many being very
handsome. The species are easily raised from seeds, layers, or cuttings.
The first two methods are the best, cuttings being very slow in growth,
but as seed is very plentiful in most years this is the quickest and
best means of propagation. Some of the varieties will come true from
seed; the Irish Yew, however, must be struck from cuttings, as seedlings
never come true. The more highly variegated Yews grow quickest when
grafted on the Common Yew, and as they always keep good in after years
this method can for once be recommended. A very good species for a lawn
is _T. cuspidata_; it is strong in growth and spreading.

Propagate PRUMNOPITYS and SAXEGOTHEA by seeds, cuttings, or layers.


CONIFERS AT MURTHLY CASTLE, PERTHSHIRE

[Illustration: _AVENUE OF ANCIENT YEWS AT MURTHLY._]

The following account of a great Conifer garden in Scotland is
important, as showing how certain of the better-known species have
behaved during the last fifty years or so. It is taken from the _Garden_
of May 19, 1900:--

The second quarter of the present century saw the introduction of a
large number of Conifers hitherto unknown to English gardens. Their
cultivation was eagerly taken up, and especially in Scotland, a land
whose general conditions seem highly favourable to a considerable number
of species, much success has been attained. It may still be premature to
state with any degree of assurance what may be the ultimate suitability
of many of these Conifers for growth in our islands. The lifetime of a
tree is not comprised within its first sixty years, and such a length of
time is all too short to prove the ultimate success of any new tree,
though within that space it may come to a magnificent size and apparent
promise. Such a state is shown by the splendid Douglas Firs in the
grounds of Murthly Castle, Perthshire, where also many another exotic
Conifer is grown in quantity.

These words of Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, that formed part of his
opening address on the second day of the Conifer conference of the Royal
Horticultural Society in 1891, may here be quoted:--

"Any one who had not travelled in Scotland could form no idea of the
extent to which rare Conifers were cultivated in that country, and the
splendid development which they attained. The chairman, by way of
illustrating these remarks, directed the attention of the audience to
some large photographs representing specimens of Coniferæ to be seen at
Murthly Castle, Perthshire, where they flourished, and where stately and
magnificent examples 70 feet, 80 feet, and 100 feet high were to be met
with. Such trees could only be seen in Scotland, and were the result of
a peculiar association of physical conditions. In the south-west of
England it was impossible to find a parallel, though even on the
sunburnt soil of Kew good specimens of the Pines proper were
occasionally to be seen. With regard to the Abies, however--that section
of Conifers of which the Spruces may be taken as a type--a state of
things prevailed in Scotland which could not be rivalled in England. On
the other hand, the climate in the south-west of the latter country was
fairly suitable for some other Conifers, and many of the fine Mexican
Pines could be grown there."

Of the remarkable Douglas Fir at Dropmore, Mr. Charles Herrin on the
same occasion says: "The monarch Douglas Fir, planted in 1830, has
attained a height of 120 feet, girth of trunk 11 feet 9 inches, with
beautiful spreading branches sweeping the ground, covering a diameter of
64 feet. The leaves are also of a glaucous hue, equalling in that
respect many of the plants now sold from nurseries under the name of
_Douglasi glauca_.... Many trees have since been raised from its seeds
and planted out on the estate; one, planted in 1843, is now 78 feet
high, with a girth of trunk of 8 feet 2 inches, spreading 39 feet in
diameter at base; a perfect specimen."

By comparing the growth of the latter tree with the Murthly table, it
will be seen that the trees make their growth much more rapidly in
Scotland. The Murthly Conifers were all planted by Sir William and Sir
Douglas Stewart. The present owner, Mr. Steuart Fothringham, who
measured the trees in 1891 in anticipation of the visit of the Scottish
Arboricultural Society, on learning that we should be glad to know their
increase of growth since that date, has been so good as to have the same
trees measured again, the increase being shown by the subjoined table on
p. 128.

Mr. Fothringham also furnishes the following remarks: "The measurements
were all carefully taken by sending men or boys up the trees, not by
dendrometers, and are, I believe, correct. There are something like
eighty or a hundred different varieties growing at Murthly, but some of
them are young and only experiments. Those measured and noted are the
most striking; they are nearly all growing in large numbers. The remarks
appended to the table are made by Mr. James Laurie, the gardener, who
knows Conifers well. The only additional notes I have made are the
following: _Picea sitchensis_ will never, in my opinion, supplant the
Spruce. _Picea orientalis_ is not as free-growing as the Spruce, but
quite as hardy. _Araucaria imbricata._--Many of these were damaged by
severe frost. _Cedrus Deodara_ will not, in my opinion, live to great
age in our climate. _Cupressus thyoides._--This particular tree was so
much broken by branches blown off its neighbour that I cut it down.
_Pinus monticola_ has been attacked by a parasitic growth that is likely
to destroy all the young growth and probably the trees. _Juniperus
recurva_ was severely injured by the hard frost. By the hard frost I
mean the winter of 1894-5. In February 1895, the thermometer was for
several days below 0 Fahr., and on one night went to 11° below 0. This
shows that all these trees will stand great cold at the time of year
that it is likely to come, but late frosts in spring, when the sap has
begun to rise, are detrimental to the young shoots of those that start
their growth early in the season. There are at Murthly, besides
Coniferæ, fine specimens of Yews, Oaks, Beech, Spanish Chestnut, Horse
Chestnut, and Sycamore."

CHAPTER XVII

CARE OF OLD TREES


The charm of many an estate is not the garden or the woodland, but the
monarchs that for years have weathered the winter storm and stand out as
noble specimens of their family. Often there are fine trees of rarer
species which their owners naturally wish to preserve from decay as long
as possible. Belonging to this class are numerous specimens scattered
over the country of American and other foreign trees that were amongst
the first of their kind to be introduced to Britain, such, for instance,
as the Tulip tree, the Robinia, and various oaks from America, the
Sophora from China, and various European trees. The trees may have some
historic associations, but whether this is so or not, when they begin to
decay efforts are made to save them from absolute death. Decay is
harmful and objectionable in park and garden, and we are not sure that
this matter of decay in trees has been so well considered as it might
be, as bearing upon the health of other trees and of mankind also. A
tree may be picturesque in decay, but we prefer it in health and beauty.
Experts are frequently asked for remedies to arrest decay in old trees.

The two principal causes of decay are starvation at the root and injury
by storms and disease. Such trees as the Beech and Horse Chestnut, that
root close to the surface of the soil--quite different from the Oak--may
often be invigorated by covering the ground with a few inches of good
soil or short manure. Artificial watering, during prolonged drought,
when thoroughly done, is also very helpful to the tree. Trees with large
crowns of branches are frequently seen thinly furnished with foliage,
and altogether sickly owing to unhealthy or insufficient roots. The
balance between top and bottom has been destroyed. To restore it in some
degree the top-growth may be reduced by pruning out and shortening back
branches here and there, wherever it can be done without spoiling the
appearance of the tree. This demands careful judgment, but some old and
sickly trees may certainly be restored in a measure by this help. It is
of no value in the case of trees with decayed trunks, nor with those
like our Common Oak, which will not break readily from old wood. But
Elms, Robinias, and Red Oaks are among those that respond to this
treatment.

Old trees with insecure branches can often be saved from destruction by
fastening the main branches together on to the trunk. The common
practice of putting an iron collar round the branch is a mistake. The
iron prevents the branch expanding naturally, and ultimately chokes it.
A better way is to use a strong iron rod with a plate at the end, and
instead of supporting the branch by encircling it, a hole is bored right
through the centre of it, through which the rod is pushed from the
outer side. The rod should be of tough iron or steel, and should exactly
fit the hole bored by the augur; the portions embedded in the wood
should be smeared with coal tar before they are pushed through, so as to
make the holes as nearly as possible air and water-tight. One end of the
rod should be "threaded" sufficiently to allow of the limbs being braced
slightly by screwing up the nut, and thus supporting some of their
weight. Finally, the bark should be neatly cut away so as to let in each
of the iron plates closer to the living wood, for by this means the time
required for closing over the plate by new wood is shortened. In this
way the weight is borne by the iron plate, which should, by removing
sufficient bark, be allowed to fit close in to the wood. New bark will
gradually close over and hide the plate, and instead of an ugly collar
cutting into the wood, the only evidence of artificial aid is the rod
coming from the inner side of the branch.

Branches or snags that have to be removed should be sawn off quite close
to the trunk or larger branch from which they spring. When a stump, even
not more than a few inches long, is left, the new bark and wood are
unable to close over it, and the wood ultimately decays and acts as a
medium for moisture and fungoid diseases. The saw should travel from
point A to B, as in the sketch. When a stump is left (as would be done
by sawing off at C D) decay sets in sooner or later. Although the tree
often succeeds in healing over the dead part, it more often fails to do
so until the decay has reached the trunk itself. With the softer-wooded
trees like the Horse-Chestnuts disease frequently reaches the heart of
the tree quickly by these means. A coating of liquid tar over the wound,
renewed once or twice until the new bark has closed over, is a sure
protection against these evils.

A good deal may be done in the early training of a tree to so control
its building up that it may best withstand the violence of gales. And
the most important matter in this connexion is the development of a
strong erect trunk, a central axis of such height and strength and bulk
as to be capable of supporting its head of branches easily. In other
words the leading shoot should always be watched, and, by the repression
of any rival leaders that may appear, allowed to retain its
predominance. In the best English nurseries only trees with good "leads"
are sent out.

[Illustration: When a broken stump, such as is here shown, has to be
sawn off, the proper place to amputate it is from A to B; the wrong
place from C to D.]

Trees decayed in the centre, with only an outer layer of healthy wood,
are, of course, doomed, but by filling up all holes in the earlier
stages of decay, and thus keeping out moisture, their term of life can
be lengthened by many years.

Holes made by woodpeckers can sometimes be plugged up with a piece of
Oak. This, if left on a level with the bark, will often enable the
latter to close over the hole. Large holes may be filled with cement, or
even built up with bricks, the surface being made water-tight and tarred
over.




CHAPTER XVIII

TREES AND SHRUBS FOR WATERSIDE


Many of the brightest garden pictures at the present day are by the
well-planted pond or lakeside, where shrubs of large growth are grouped
to give colour through summer and winter.

The wild plants of the riverside are in themselves for the most part
large of stature and important of appearance. When one sees the upright
growth and large leaves of the Great Water Dock (Rumex) and the broad
round ones (2 feet or more across) of the Butter-Bur (Petasites), and
the beds of the Common Reed (Phragmites), 8 to 10 feet high, with its
great brown-black plumes, and the curious bright-green Horsetail
(Equisetum), and the rosy banks of Willow-herb and Loose-strife, and the
calm wide breadths of the white Water Lily in the still backwaters; when
we see all these lessons that Nature teaches by the riverside we
perceive that for the best of good effect of waterside gardening we need
not be afraid of planting things of bold growth largely.

[Illustration: _ALDERS NEAR WATER (Catkin time)._]

When we come to garden plants there are many families that are never so
happy as when close to water, or in soil that always feels the cool,
moistening influence of water within a few feet below them. Such are
the whole range of the larger herbaceous Spiræas, some of them plants of
great size. Then we have the Thalictrums, the autumn-flowering Phloxes,
the stately Heracleum; Telekia, Bamboos, _Arundo Donax_, the Swamp and
Meadow Lilies of the northern states of America; and coming to smaller
though scarcely less important plants, the Scarlet Lobelias, Oriental
Poppies, many Irises, the Michaelmas Daisies, and Day Lilies; all these
thrive by the waterside.

[Illustration: _WHITE WILLOW (Salix alba) BY WATERSIDE._]

There are many shrubs that prefer a moist place, such as the Guelder
Rose and the beautiful North American Halesia, Quinces, Rhododendrons,
Azaleas, and Kalmias, while the lovely Fritillaries, Globe-flowers, and
the double Cuckoo-flowers love damp grassy spaces. We think we may
safely advise those who are making gardens by river or lake to go
forward and plant with confidence, only selecting such things as are
mentioned below.

As the things named are described elsewhere in this book a list only is
given.


TREES AND SHRUBS FOR SWAMPY PLACES

Willows (Salix) in great variety: _S. alba_ (White Willow), _S.
babylonica_ (Babylonian Weeping Willow), _S. purpurea_, _S. p. pendula_
(American Weeping Willow), _S. Caprea_, _S. C. pendula_, the fine
Kilmarnock Willow, Cardinal Willow and Golden Willow--both these are
very beautiful in winter; the stems of the former are crimson, and of
the latter golden yellow, and make a remarkable picture of intense
colouring; plant them in large groups--_S. daphnoides_ (the
White-stemmed Willow), _S. fragilis_ (Crack Willow), _S. f. basfordiana_
(Red-barked Willow), and _S. hippophaifolia_ (Sea Buckthorn-leaved
Willow).

_Populus alba_ (White Poplar), _P. deltoidea_ (Canadian Poplar), _P.
nigra_ (Black Poplar), Lombardy Poplar, and _P. tremula_ (the Aspen).
But the Poplars must not be overdone, and by pond or lakeside are often
out of place. In such places the Cardinal and Yellow-barked Willow, Sea
Buckthorn, and similar shrubs are more appropriate.

Common Alder, with its many varieties--Cut-leaved, the Golden-leaved,
and such as _Alnus incana_ and _A. serrulata_.

_Taxodium distichum_ (Deciduous Cypress); tender green in spring and
brownish red in autumn, when the leaves change colour.

_Hippophaë rhamnoides_ (the Sea Buckthorn).

[Illustration: _NATURAL TREE GROWTH BY WATER (Burnham Beeches.)_]


TREES AND SHRUBS FOR MOIST (BUT NOT SWAMPY) SOIL

_Berberis Darwinii_ (Darwin's Barberry), _B. Thunbergi_ (for its
beautiful autumn leaf-colouring), Birch, Dogwoods, _Cornus alba_ and
varieties; the variety _sibirica_ has brilliant-red stems. _Cotoneaster
buxifolia_, _C. frigida_, _C. Nummularia_, _C. Simonsii_; Ash, _Myrica
Gale_ (Sweet Gale) and _M. asplenifolia_; _Ledum palustre_, _Nyssa
sylvatica_ (Tupelo tree), Mountain Ash, _Quercus aquatica_ (Water Oak),
_Q. palustris_ (Swamp Oak); _Rhamnus Frangula_ (Buckthorn). Roses
with brightly-coloured hips--_Rubus biflorus_ (White-stemmed Bramble),
_R. fruticosus fl. pl._ (Double Pink Bramble). _R. laciniatus_
(Cut-leaved Bramble), _R. spectabilis_ (Salmon Berry). _Sambucus
racemosa_ (Red-berried Elder), _Spiræa Douglasii_, _S. hypericifolia_,
_S. lindleyana_; Tamarisk. _Viburnum Opulus_ (Guelder Rose); when this
native shrub is weighed down with the rich red berry-clusters, it is a
remarkable colour picture, and the autumn leaf tints add to its beauty.

Of Conifers, mention may be made of _Tsuga canadensis_, _Picea
sitchensis_, _Cupressus thyoides_, and _Thuya gigantea_.

Bamboos: Select those of robust growth, such as _Arundinaria japonica_
(_Bambusa Metake_), _A. Simoni_, _A. Veitchii_, and _A. palmata_;
_Phyllostachys viridi-glaucescens_ and _P. mitis_.

CHAPTER XIX

TREES AND SHRUBS FOR THE ROCK GARDEN


If we think of the changes in gardening terms which have occurred during
the last quarter of a century, there is surely significance in the
gradual transition from the Rock Garden or Alpine Garden into the more
imposing Rock Garden of our present-day language. It points to the
bolder grouping--now happily adopted in most good gardens and more in
accordance with Nature's pattern--which includes evergreen and flowering
shrubs as well as the close-growing alpine plants, gem-like in their
brilliant colours, which in earlier days were alone considered suitable
for the purpose. The principle is now generally recognised that the
"unstudied picturesqueness of Nature may be brought into the rule and
line ordering of our gardens," and the better construction and
government of the Rock Garden gives greater scope for the carrying out
of this worthy effort.

In enumerating suitable shrubs for the Rock Garden, more than ordinary
care should be exercised in their selection, in view of the greater
difficulty of rectifying mistakes in such positions. We must not be led
away by the beauty of a shrub, for instance, during its time of
flowering alone, without considering its character at other seasons and
its adaptability to its special surroundings. A due sense of proportion
will also hold us back from planting a spreading, hungry-natured shrub
in limited space, or where it would rob and over-run more valuable but
weaker plants. Such considerations as these must be left to the planter
who, in his turn, must be guided by the incidental circumstances of his
particular locality. It is only possible here to set down some of the
best shrubs available for the purpose, and to indicate, in a very
general way, the positions for which they are suitable.

Occasionally, where there is ample space, a deciduous tree of low growth
may be planted to great advantage. Not long ago, in a picturesque
district bordering on Western Germany, a mental note was made of the
excellent effect of Wild Medlar trees, scarcely more than good-sized
bushes, growing about the boulders and overhanging the edge of quarried
rocks. The white flowers in spring, and the fine form and tint of the
russet-brown fruit as it gradually swells during the summer months, give
this tree a peculiar claim on our attention where the position is
suitable. But in planning the main features of the Rock Garden, we
naturally turn our thoughts first to evergreen trees and shrubs, because
the plants grown in such positions, being usually either alpine or
herbaceous, are mostly in abeyance during the winter, and it is
desirable that the rockery, no less than every other part of the garden,
should be interesting even if it cannot be gay, during the period of
rest. A specimen Holly or, in exceptionally mild climates, a tall bush,
from 8 to 10 feet high, of _Pittosporum undulatum_, one of the most
beautiful of New Zealand evergreen trees, may be so placed, for example,
as to be exceedingly pictorial; but, as a rule, we must keep our shrubs
to an average maximum height of not more than from 4 to 5 feet, and,
generally speaking, those of still lower stature are better suited to
the ordinary Rock Garden.

[Illustration: _CISTUSES AND ROSES IN THE ROCK GARDEN._

(_In the left lower corner, Cistus hirsutus; middle, Rosa alba; to
right, R. rugosa Mme. Georges Bruant._)]

Some of the small-growing Conifers, from their compact habit and
distinct character, are especially well fitted to break the outline and
to give contrast. We think of Pines and Spruce Firs and Cedars as
majestic trees, and it is only when one comes to study them in their
manifold varieties that we find how many of these range from a height of
only a few inches to 3 feet, or at most to 4 feet.

Some species, it is true, do not lend themselves gracefully to the
dwarfing process, becoming clumpy and inelegant, but this charge cannot
be brought against many of the Cypresses and Junipers. Several of the
smaller Conifers, besides, give the advantage of distinct variations of
colour with the changing seasons. Reference is not now made to the
golden and silver forms, so-called, which occur in most of the genera,
and put on their brightest tints in spring, but to the deeper winter
colouring assumed, _e.g._ by the interesting _Retinospora ericoides_,
which alters its summer tone of dark green to purple brown on the
approach of cold weather; or by _Cryptomeria elegans_, a little less
hardy, which changes to a fine shade of bronzy crimson. Like other
plants, Conifers differ greatly as to constitution, and judgment must be
used in their choice. The dwarf alpine form of the Common Juniper
(_Juniperus communis nana_) is very hardy and slow-growing, never
becoming too rampant for the smallest Rock Garden, and shares the
blue-grey tint which is so characteristic of this beautiful species. _J.
c. alpina aurea_ is a delightful small-growing Conifer. In summer the
foliage is light yellow, and in winter heavily shaded with bronzy
yellow. Very distinct from it is the lovely prostrate Savin (_J. Sabina
procumbens_), one of the best of evergreen shrubs for the Rock Garden,
and one most restful and satisfying to the eye at all times in its deep
tones of sea green. A first-rate variety is _J. S. tamariscifolia_,
which is of very spreading growth.

[Illustration: _DWARF SHRUBS ON ROCK GARDEN._]

_Cupressus pisifera_, almost plumose in one of its many variations, and
_C. obtusa_, both better known perhaps under the garden name of
Retinosporas, are admirable, and may be used either in the normal or the
dwarf forms according to the greater or less space at command. Almost
the last tree, probably, which one would expect to see draping the
vertical face of a rock is the Spruce Fir, yet a weeping variety (_Picea
excelsa pendula_) is exceedingly effective in such a position as a foil
to hanging masses of richly-coloured Aubrietias or Golden Alyssum, while
it looks well at all seasons. Mention may here be made of a remarkable
Conifer, _Cunninghamia sinensis_, of great beauty and very distinct
character, which takes the shape, in our climate, of a spreading bush,
though in its native habitat it grows into a tree of noble dimensions.
It is suitable only for a Rock Garden of some boldness of construction,
and in gardens favoured with a mild climate and a sheltered position,
but under such happy circumstances a place should certainly be found for
this handsome and little-known China Fir.

Another uncommon coniferous shrub, also very distinct and more generally
useful than the last, is _Podocarpus alpina_. Though a native of
Tasmania, it grows at high elevations, and is able to resist severe
frost. Dark green in foliage, only about 2 feet in height, and of a
somewhat spreading nature, it is never out of place in the Rock Garden,
whether large or small.

From Conifers we may pass to Veronicas, certain of which might almost be
mistaken for some minute form of Cypress. Of this character is a small
group known in New Zealand, the natural habitat of a large number of
shrubby species, by the apposite name of Whipcord Veronicas. Being
themselves alpine, they are particularly well suited for grouping with
low-growing mountain plants. Six species or varieties of this
interesting section grow naturally at elevations ranging from 7000 to
4000 feet, and are much more hardy than is generally supposed. These
are: _V. cupressoides_, _V. c. var. variabilis_, _V. lycopodioides_, _V.
Armstrongii_, _V. Hectori_, _V. loganioides_.

The form of _V. cupressoides_, known as _variabilis_, was mistaken, on
its first introduction, for a distinct species, _V. salicornoides_, and
may still be met with under that name. The small violet or white flowers
of these miniature evergreen shrubs are not perhaps much to be taken
into account, but they have a distinct value of their own as rock-work
greenery. There are other dwarf New Zealand Veronicas of a leafy
character, differing essentially from these mimetic species, such as _V.
carnosula_ and _V. pinguifolia_, also inhabiting regions 5000 feet above
the sea-level, which are suited for localities with average advantages
of climate. Others again, such as _V. Lyallii_, _V. glauco-cærulea_, and
_V. hulkeana_, though they grow naturally at lower altitudes, and must
be reckoned only half-hardy, may yet be serviceable for Rock Gardens on
the southern sea-board, or on the west coast of Scotland. Belonging to
the larger-growing and more familiar species of Shrubby Veronica,
mention may be made of a good purple-flowered hybrid, of very compact
growth, known as Purple Queen, which is exceedingly ornamental from its
free-flowering habit. Many of the losses sustained amongst these
interesting New Zealand shrubs are owing to drought rather than to
frost, and their extreme susceptibility to dryness at the root is a fact
not recognised as it should be.

Hardy Heaths are of the utmost value in the Rock Garden, and range in
height from the 6 feet or more of _Erica arborea_ to the 6 inches of the
well-known _E. carnea_, and can be used in rough places, where more
delicate plants might not thrive. A sudden emergency once arose in the
experience of the writer, when a shelving mass of earth had to be
shored-up as quickly as possible with such material as lay ready to hand
at the moment. This happened to be found in a heap of ugly, yellowish,
water-worn boulders of great size, which abound in that particular
locality, at no great distance below the ground-level, and must be dug
out when any deep trenching has to be done. There was no time to be
wasted in facing the stones, which would have made them more sightly,
and they had to be used as they were. Fortunately a large consignment of
the best hardy Heaths had lately arrived from the Darley Dale Nurseries,
and were immediately seized upon to cover up the ugliness of the
hastily-built-up barricade. Boulders and Heaths, however, took to each
other kindly, in spite of a soil by no means specially suitable, and
with the addition, later, of a few good kinds of Cistus and other
shrubs, the bank still remains as happy a bit of rough planting as could
be desired.

Of the taller Heaths, _E. lusitanica_ is somewhat tender, and is not so
generally useful as _E. mediterranea_ or _E. arborea_ (Tree Heath). A
hybrid form--_E. mediterranea × E. carnea_--is excellent, and comes into
flower about Christmas, in advance of either of its parents, when its
pale-purple spikes are very welcome, and are quite distinct from the
rosy-red flowers of _E. carnea_: it is known as _E. mediterranea
hybrida_. The foliage of hardy Heaths is never unsightly, but the
persistent dead flowers are, and these should always be clipped off as
soon as their beauty is over, or the new growth will break away above
the withered flowers, leaving, in many cases, straggling and unclothed
branches. The omission of this needful work every season is a fruitful
source of the raggedness which brings some discredit on these otherwise
attractive plants.

Many flowering shrubs of the same natural order as Heaths, but unlike
them in general appearance, such as the Alpine Rhododendrons, _R.
ferrugineum_ and _R. hirsutum_, and the less well-known but very
beautiful and distinct _R. racemosum_, as well as some of the miniature
varieties of _Azalea indica_, notably _R. obtusa_ and its forms, seem
peculiarly suitable for the Rock Garden (see p. 428 for lists of the
best Rhododendrons). Again, where rock meets more level ground, and the
trickle of a stream can be so directed as to give moisture without
sogginess, a considerable number of peat-loving evergreen shrubs
belonging to the same order, of the type of _Gaultheria_, _Vaccinium_,
and _Pieris_, may be used with excellent effect. _Gaultheria Shallon_,
indeed, is a singularly fine shrub in any position, and is not very
exacting in any of its requirements. Growing about 2 feet high, with
purple leaf-tints in winter, and spikes of white waxy flowers, brightly
tinged with red, in spring, which are followed by purple fruit, few
things can surpass it in its way. For carpeting moist spots, the little
_G. procumbens_, which rises scarcely 3 inches from the ground, will
fill a useful place with its winter colouring of crimson brown. Shrubs
of this class are well worth study by those whose locality admits of
their cultivation.

For dry, sunny, and stony banks Rock Roses may be chosen, but the
position must be wind-screened, a more important factor in the question
of their hardiness than cold. The large-growing Gum Cistus is well known
and tolerably hardy everywhere, and so also is _C. laurifolius_, but
there are several most desirable species of dwarfer growth, such as the
white, crimson-spotted _C. lusitanicus_, the pink-flowered _C.
villosus_, the bright-red _C. crispus_, and the pure white _C.
florentinus_, which are quite happy in sheltered rock walks especially
by the sea; they have been also grown with success in many colder
situations inland. The Cistineæ, at best, are somewhat short-lived, and
lose vigour and power of resistance as they grow older. Keep up,
therefore, young, thrifty stock by yearly cuttings to fill up inevitable
gaps, which is a matter of no cultural difficulty. Where Rock Roses are
out of the question, their place may worthily be filled by the hardier
shrubby _Helianthemums_, though they differ greatly from Cistineæ in
their trailing habit and smaller flowers. The breadths of brilliant
colour given by these Sun Roses while in bloom are invaluable, and may
be enjoyed to the full in almost any locality, while the many variations
of tint, from deep green to ashen grey, in their leafage should also be
taken into consideration, as it increases their usefulness when out of
flower.

No list of good shrubs for the Rock Garden would be complete without
some reference to _Yuccas_, which for all practical purposes must be
included under that head. Groups of these magnificent plants, with their
sub-tropical effect, cannot be surpassed for nobility of outline and
stateliness of flower. To do them full justice, they must have space to
develop their grand proportions, but this may often be found on the
ridge or upper slope, even in rock-work of limited character. _Y.
gloriosa_, with its fine form, _Y. recurva_, and the stemless _Y.
flaccida_, of smaller growth, are amongst the best and hardiest kinds,
and to these may be added _Y. angustifolia_, another valuable and nearly
stemless species.

It is only possible, in restricted space, to touch in a very cursory way
upon a few of the available groups of dwarf-growing shrubs. Many more
than have been mentioned will occur readily to the minds of those who
are at all conversant with plants, such as _Abelia rupestris_, _Magnolia
stellata_, several beautiful species of _Daphne_, some of the St. John's
Worts, of low-growing _Cytisus_, and others which may be classed under
the head of miscellaneous. The subjoined list, though it does not
pretend to be exhaustive, will be found of use, either for purposes of
winter greenery or for summer embellishment, by those who are seeking
good and suitable dwarf shrubs for planting, under varied conditions in
the Rock Garden.

CHAPTER XX

REMOVAL OF LARGE TREES AND SHRUBS


Probably no garden operation requires more time and labour than the
proper removal of large trees and shrubs from one part of a garden to
another. Time, as it will take two, or even three, days to remove a
large tree to a distance; and labour, as the services of from eight to
twelve men will be required to accomplish the work. It is not,
therefore, an operation to be lightly undertaken or got through in a
hurry.

Before proceeding to describe the various ways of moving large specimen
plants, it will be well to consider the trees and shrubs that are
generally required to be moved. Three numbered lists are given arranged
according to the roots of the shrubs or trees--that is, those that, when
they have stood for some time in one place, are most alike as regards
the way their roots are placed together; and the lists are also some
guide when transplanting, as the chances of life after removal are
greatest in No. 1, less in No. 2, and considerably lower in No. 3.

 ,,  (Portugal).

Coniferæ.

It will be noticed that Conifers are mentioned in the third list, and
even in nurseries where they are regularly moved the mortality amongst
them is very high; and the removal of large Conifers should never be
attempted except with a transplanting machine, and expert men to handle
it. As a rule, it will be found cheaper and better to buy young plants
than to attempt the removal of large ones that have stood for some years
without root disturbance. Such flowering shrubs as _Spiræa_,
_Philadelphus_, _Kerria_, _Ribes_, &c., can be safely moved without much
trouble, as they make a mass of roots which will hold a good ball of
soil unless it is very dry. All are practically certain to live if
carefully planted and well watered afterwards.

There are several ways of moving large trees, the simplest and quickest
being by a proper transplanting machine, which consists of a framework
on wheels fitted with a system of rollers and levers. For
moderately-sized trees, say, to about 12 feet high, a two-wheeled
machine is sufficient. This is moved by eight or ten men. For trees
above 12 feet high a four-wheeled machine is required, with two, or
perhaps three, horses to draw it. The first will take a ball of soil
weighing from two to three tons, the latter anything to ten tons, or
even more.

In preparing the tree for the small machine the ball is made round, and
slightly smaller than the width of the machine, a trench being cut round
the tree to a depth of 3 feet or so, the actual depth depending on the
roots, but the soil should be removed a foot lower than the lowest
roots. On no account undermine the ball until the proper depth has been
reached. A proper machine-pick is the best thing to use under the ball,
carefully working out sufficient soil to introduce a board 6 inches wide
and about 1½ inches thick on each side of the ball. The soil immediately
under the centre of the ball should be left intact. When the boards are
in position ropes are passed under them on each side and led up over
the rollers on the machine and fastened, and then by levers the ropes
are rolled up, swinging the plant up cleanly and with a good ball of
soil. Before putting the ropes under, however, a stout piece of canvas
or mat should be tied round the ball with a couple of cords, between
which and the canvas seven or eight pieces of narrow flat board should
be fixed to prevent the cords from cutting the ball. The rear part of
the machine is made to be taken out so that it can be pushed right over
a plant, and it should be run on planks on soft ground.

With the large transplanting machine a ball of soil of almost any size
can be taken, but the method of preparing it is somewhat different. It
should be made nearly square, being rather longer than it is broad. When
the proper depth has been reached make a hole about 2 feet wide under
the centre of the ball, and running entirely through the longer way of
it. Through this hole one, or even two, broad planks 3 inches thick
should be passed. On each end of these, where they project beyond the
ball, a stout plank is laid on edge, and two others placed lengthwise to
fit above the first two. These planks should all be cut to fit tightly
into each other. If necessary, owing to the depth of the ball, another
tier of planks should be placed above the first to insure stability. The
machine is then placed over the plant, and the whole, by means of chains
and levers, is swung up off the ground, and then ready to be taken
anywhere. This machine, however, should only be used by those who have
had experience with it, as it is difficult and cumbersome to handle,
and in the hands of novices is liable to cause serious accidents.

Where no transplanting machine exists, other mechanical contrivances
must be used to move a large tree. Rollers and planks, a low trolley, or
a draw-board, as it is called, are the best. The preparation for removal
is the same for these means as it is for a machine, with the exception
of getting under it, which varies according to the means employed. For
rollers and planks the soil should be worked out directly under the
centre of the ball, and planks put through to form a bed to run the
shrub or tree on. On these a roller should be placed, working the soil
out at the sides so that it is well under the ball, but not going so far
under as to undermine it, and cause it to drop over. Above the roller
put one wide plank to form the bottom of the ball, and by means of a
rope round it the whole can be taken where required. When moving it,
however, it is well to raise the rear half by means of a broad lever or
a lifting-jack, which, in conjunction with a steady pull on the rope,
should start the plant comfortably on its journey.

When a low trolley is used the ball of soil must be firm, and not liable
to break to pieces when handled with reasonable care. Having cut out the
ball to the required depth, work under it all round, merely leaving
enough in the centre to support it. If possible, work off some of the
upper soil to decrease the weight, but this depends entirely upon the
roots, and the way they run. If small roots are plentiful at the top,
little or no soil can be removed, but if they are lower down, then the
upper soil may be removed with advantage. Having worked under the ball,
lay two stout planks under it well packed up to the centre, and then
with two strong poles under the ends of the planks lift the whole on the
trolley. If the work is carefully thought out, it is possible to make
the actual lifting a very small operation by bringing the trolley close
and lowering it considerably.

The draw-board is a handy contrivance for moderate-sized trees or shrubs
which will hold a good ball of soil. It is made in two forms. One
consists of a piece of well-seasoned oak 3 inches thick, and about 3
feet long by 2 to 2½ feet wide at the widest part, from which it slopes
down to a thick end, where a stout swivel-ring is fixed to take a rope.
The other form is a kind of trolley, and consists of a frame 3 feet long
by 2 feet wide; it runs on rollers that work on bent irons fastened to
the framework, the whole standing about 4 inches high. Either of these
can be used for moving plants the ball of soil attached to which is not
larger than the board. They will take a heavy plant with comparative
ease, and are especially useful for moving large Rhododendrons and other
American shrubs. To get them under a plant cut out the ball of soil to
the proper depth, and work under it from the front, that is, the
direction in which the plant is to go, keeping the ball wedged up during
the process, _not_ by having a man to pull the top over, but by using
wedges or levers underneath it, until sufficient soil has been worked
out to allow the board to be inserted. When the board is in position the
rope should be passed through the ring and then around the collar, using
a piece of mat to keep it from rubbing the bark off, and then back
through the ring again. It is well to run the board over planks on soft
ground to reduce the labour of pulling.

In putting the tree or shrub into its new position, carefully measure
the size of the ball, and make the hole considerably larger and slightly
deeper, breaking up the bottom well. When the tree or shrub is in
position ram the soil tightly round it until it is about two-thirds
covered, when the hole should be completely filled with water, covering
in the remainder when the water has drained away. The stem must also be
made secure by means of stakes or cords, otherwise wind will cause
damage to the roots.

When the ground is dry under a tree that is to be moved nothing should
be done until it has been thoroughly soaked. To do this a trench 2 feet
deep and as narrow as possible should be taken out all round, and
gradually filled in with water, pouring it in steadily, away from the
ball rather than to it, and persevere with this watering till the ball
of soil under the tree is thoroughly saturated. Leave it for at least
twenty-four hours to drain. Three points must not be forgotten: (1) Wrap
the ball of soil securely round with canvas as soon as possible; (2)
never use the stem of a tree as a lever in moving the ball--this should
always be moved from below, and the stem never touched on any account;
(3) always allow plenty of room for working.

Moving large trees is not easy and must not be lightly undertaken. It
involves much time, labour, and expense, in most cases far more than the
trees are worth. Trees 8 or 10 feet high may be easily moved, but above
that height the work should be done by an expert. Trees and shrubs of
considerable size can be purchased at a moderate price from good tree
nurseries, where they have been regularly transplanted, and if carefully
planted will soon make good specimens.

It is in the planting of trees that so many failures occur as a rule. A
good tree may be obtained, arrive in excellent condition, and yet be
planted in such a way that success is out of the question. The fault, as
a matter of course, is put on the man who supplied the tree, not on the
one who killed it by improper planting. Those who think of moving large
trees or shrubs should not do so until the probable cost has been
considered, and the advice and help obtained of some one who has handled
big trees before. The expert will be able to say if a tree can bear
removal, or whether it is better destroyed, and its place filled with a
young and vigorous specimen from a nursery.




CHAPTER XXI

YOUNG TREES AND SUNSTROKE


It is most noticeable that the stems of young trees of from 8 to about
14 feet in height are apt in some seasons to get much damaged, so much
so that the trees are rarely satisfactory for some years afterwards,
even if they do not die outright. The mischief is usually not seen until
it is too late to mend matters, and is found more as a rule on young
trees with small heads standing out singly than where they are planted
amongst undergrowth or in partial shade. If careful notice is taken it
will be found that the stems are damaged on the south side, or it may be
east or west of south, but never on the north side, and this is directly
caused by the rays of the sun being too hot for the young stems to bear.
The trees most liable to sunstroke--which it practically amounts to--are
the Lime, Willow, Horse Chestnut, Sweet Chestnut, Birch, Mountain Ash,
Ash, and Plane, and generally in the order they are given, the softer
wooded trees suffering more severely than those of harder growth. The
Oak, Elm, and Beech are seldom much damaged by the sun, though in cases
of failure it will be well to notice the stems and see how far the
direct rays of the sun are responsible for the death of the tree.

The first marks of sunstroke are seen in the shape of longitudinal
cracks in the bark, which is also slightly browned and flattened, as if
there were a hollow beneath. The part affected is from about 1 to 3 feet
in length, and from 1 to 3 inches in width. If the bark is cut away the
wood beneath will be found perfectly firm, but hard and dry, more like a
piece of seasoned wood than part of a growing tree. When such is the
case the only thing that can be done is to cut away the bark back to the
living tissue, thoroughly coat the wound with gas tar, and shade the
stem afterwards with a few branches or something that does not need to
be fastened on the stem. Hay or straw bands cannot be altogether
recommended, as anything which excludes the light tends to the softening
of the young bark. This should be avoided, as the firmer the bark the
better will be the ultimate success of the tree. Iron tree-guards,
though not beautiful, have the advantage of protecting the stems of
young trees from the sun as well as from the attacks of animals. In
addition to the slight shade they give, the iron, being a good conductor
of heat, takes up a large amount of the heat rays which would otherwise
be directed full upon the stem.

A hot and dry season is no more likely to cause sunstroke than a wet
one, and probably not so much, as we have noticed it in sunless years
quite as much as in bright summers. The time when it is most likely to
happen is when a few days of hot sunshine follow a spell of wet weather,
as the wood is then soft and full of moisture, and is more liable to be
scorched than during a period of prolonged sunshine.

When trees are planted out singly it is well to choose those with
spreading heads and low stems, as then the tree will shade itself to a
great extent, the short amount of bare stem being less exposed to the
sun's rays than a taller one. After all, this is only Nature's method of
protection, as, in a wild state, no young tree is bare-stemmed, except
in a wood, where it is shaded by those near it. On the edge of a wood,
or in the open, young trees are furnished to the ground with foliage,
which is not shed until the stem has become hardened enough to withstand
climatic vicissitudes. If trees with tall stems are the only ones
available, then the stems should be shaded by some means for a year or
two, especially when they have become established and are making strong,
sappy growths, as the stem is practically in the same condition and apt
to be scorched by a sudden burst of hot sunshine.


GOAT AND WOOD-LEOPARD MOTHS

Sunstroke must not be confounded with the ravages of the caterpillars of
the Goat Moth and Wood-Leopard Moth, the external signs of which are
much the same, but on the bark being removed one or two channels almost
the size of a man's little finger are to be seen, together with
accumulations of wet sawdust-like material deposited by the
caterpillar. These are exterminated by thrusting a stout wire into the
channels until the grub is killed, and afterwards cutting away the dead
bark and tarring the wound thoroughly. The tree should also be securely
staked, otherwise it will probably snap off in the first high wind.




CHAPTER XXII

SHADE TREES FOR STREETS


In the middle ages it was accounted an act of piety to make or maintain
a road or a bridge, or to do anything in connexion with them that would
conduce to the safety or comfort of the wayfarer. The planting of trees
for shade, or the placing of a shaded bench for rest came within the
same category of pious works. In our days, when rush and hurry and the
pressure of business, and the worship of bare utility fill the minds of
most men, there are many who have almost forgotten the gracious aspects
of the more leisurely life. It is probably from this cause that so many
opportunities are lost that might be seized by those in authority for
making the lives of our fellow-creatures somewhat easier and pleasanter.

In days of extreme heat what a difference in comfort there would be
between the bare sun-baked expanses of the streets of many a town, such
as we all know, and the same spaces carefully planted with shade-giving
trees! In very narrow streets trees are, of course, out of the question,
or in any street whose width is not enough to allow of easy traffic and
trees as well, but one cannot walk through any town, except the very few
in which the question has already been considered and satisfactorily
answered, without seeing many a street or waste space or corner where a
row or a group or even a single tree would not add immensely to both
beauty and comfort. Where there is plenty of width, and especially where
houses fall back a little from the road, the trees may well stand just
within the edge of the footpath or pavement. Should there be still more
width, there may be a row in the middle of the road. In this case the
middle row of trees should not be quite evenly continuous, but perhaps
five or six trees and then a gap, formed by leaving out one tree, in
order to allow the traffic to move from side to side of the road. In
many a town where a street runs north-east and south-west, a row of
trees on its south-western side only might be an inestimable boon.

Even in country villages there is often a bare place, especially where
roads meet, where a few trees well planted and a plain strong oak bench
would be a comfort and a pleasure to many hardworking folk, and might be
the means of converting unsightliness into beauty.

[Illustration: _PLANE TREE (Platanus orientalis)._]

For towns the Plane has the best character, but other good trees are
Wych Elm and Hornbeam, Sycamore, Maple, Lime, Lombardy Poplar, and Horse
Chestnut. The spreading growth of the Horse Chestnut commends it rather
for a space like the _place_ of a foreign town. Here is also the place
for Limes, for though they are good street trees, yet when in bloom the
strong, sweet scent, although a passing whiff is delicious, might be
an annoyance if poured continuously into the windows of houses during
the blooming time.

The Wild Cherry, with its quantity of early bloom, would be a beautiful
street tree, and in places where trees of rather smaller growth are
desired there is the Bird Cherry and the Mountain Ash. The large
American Mountain Ash is a good street tree, in autumn loaded with its
handsome bunches of scarlet fruit.

The larger Willows are also charming trees for streets. Many of the
trees named, if their tops spread too near the houses, may, with good
effect, be pollarded about 10 feet from the ground.




CHAPTER XXIII

TREES AND SHRUBS IN SCOTLAND


The following list has been kindly sent me by a great lover of trees and
shrubs who lives at Forres. My correspondent writes: "I have grown all
the plants in my list in my own garden, except _Buddleia globosa_ and
_Aralia chinensis_, but the latter is grown in quantity by several of my
neighbours, and there are also several fine plants of the Buddleia in
many gardens in sheltered spots. My experience is that many plants are
quite frost-proof but cannot stand cold winds. This applies more
especially to the shrubby Veronicas. I have seen them in the Edinburgh
Botanic Gardens as if scorched with fire on the exposed side, while they
were untouched where sheltered from the north and east. My own garden is
fairly well sheltered."

_Amelanchier canadensis._--Hardy, free-flowering, beautiful at all
times.

_Aralia chinensis (Dimorphanthus) mandschurica._--Useful in some
positions for its curious habit of growth and rather handsome foliage;
quite hardy.

_Aristolochia Sipho._--This has curious and inconspicuous flowers, which
give this climbing plant its popular name of "Dutchman's Pipe." It can
be grown on a wall, in which position, perhaps, its fine foliage is
seen to the best advantage, but it is quite hardy and looks well
climbing into a thin tree such as the Common Almond.

_Berberis (Mahonia) Aquifolium._--A handsome plant at all times, and
will even grow under the shade of trees.

_Berberis Darwinii._--Very bright in flower. Young and sappy shoots get
killed back in winter.

_Berberis Thunbergi._--A most attractive Berberis; it makes a small
neat-growing bush to which the adjective "sparkling" might be applied.
Its chief glory is its autumnal foliage, and a large clump in September
is "a sight to see"; quite hardy.

_Berberis vulgaris._--Very beautiful when clustered with fruit. The
purple-leaved variety (_B. v. purpurea_) is most useful for its foliage.

_Betula alba purpurea._--A good foliage tree.

_Buddleia globosa._--This does well in a warm sheltered spot facing
south-west, where the morning sun in winter will not touch it too soon.
It also objects to exposure to cold winds.

_Calycanthus floridus._--Quite hardy, and grows well in half-shady
places.

_Ceanothus azureus._--This succeeds either trained to a wall or as a
bush. In the latter case it should be in a sheltered position. It seems
quite frost-proof, and its blue flowers are very beautiful at a time
when few shrubs are in bloom (July and August). Its shoots should be
well thinned, and those left shortened as soon as the buds begin to show
signs of movement in the spring. The best form I have tried is Gloire de
Versailles.

_Choisya ternata_ (Mexican Orange Flower).--This is well worth growing
as a bush in a sheltered angle of a wall, where it can be protected in
winter with a hurdle or some such contrivance, lightly thatched with
Broom. It is even then, in very severe weather, cut about the points of
the shoots, which, of course, spoils the blooming; but it soon grows
through again, and it is worth growing for its foliage alone.

_Clematis._--These mostly do well, and the newer sorts are very
attractive, but for all purposes it is very hard to beat _C. montana_
and _C. Jackmani_, the former in May and the latter for the autumn.

_Clethra alnifolia._--A neat and free-flowering shrub, with spikes of
white flowers in August; it is very hardy and useful, as few shrubs are
in flower at that time.

_Cornus alba._--A clump of this Dogwood is very effective in winter,
especially when the sun is shining on its bright-red shoots. _C. a.
Spaethii_ is a good variegated variety.

_Corylus Avellana purpurea._--A good purple-leaved nut.

_Cotoneaster microphylla._--Quite hardy either as a bush or on a wall.

_Cytisus albus._--No garden should be without this beautiful Broom. _C.
præcox_, the Cream Broom, is a dwarfer but no less beautiful variety; it
is very pretty grouped with a few plants of _C. purpureus_, which
flowers at the same time. Another fine Broom is the red and yellow
variety of the Common Broom (_C. scoparius andreanus_). The Brooms will
grow anywhere, but prefer an open place in full sun. They should be cut
hard back after flowering, and if the young seed-pods can be picked off
so much the better.

_Daphne Cneorum._--A bright little shrub best grown on the rock garden;
quite hardy.

_Daphne Laureola._--This has fine foliage and will grow in quite a shady
place.

_Daphne Mezereum._--A beautiful early-flowering Daphne, too well known
for description.

_Deutzia crenata._--A most useful hardy shrub, growing to a good size.
The variety, Pride of Rochester, is very pretty.

_Diervilla (Weigela)._--Indispensable shrubs, very hardy,
free-flowering, and easily grown. The flowering shoots should be cut
back to strong young wood as soon as the flowers fade. They are most
accommodating in this respect, as the strongest of the young shoots
start well back and not at the points, as is usual with most plants.
Good varieties are Eva Rathke, _Hortensis nivea_, and _rosea_.

_Escallonia macrantha._--A good wall shrub.

_Escallonia philippiana._--Hardier than _E. macrantha_, and can be grown
as a bush in a sheltered spot.

_Forsythia suspensa._--Quite hardy, and very beautiful in early spring,
as it flowers before the leaf-buds burst. It should be cut back to young
growths after the flower is over.

_Fuchsia Riccartoni._--This gets cut down every winter, but is never
killed, and it flowers abundantly every year treated as a hardy
herbaceous plant.

_Garrya elliptica._--Quite hardy as a bush.

_Genista tinctoria fl. pl._--A low-growing trailing Genista, useful for
the rock garden and flowering when many of the alpines are over.

_Genista virgata._--A very different plant from the above, and will make
a very large bush, covered with pale-yellow flowers in late summer. A
good shrub.

_Halesia tetraptera._--Quite hardy and attractive both in bloom and
foliage.

_Hamamelis arborea._--This is quite hardy, but grows very slowly. It
flowers in a small state, but not very freely. I have only had this
plant for four years, but I think it will do very well, and should
flower more freely when a bit larger.

_Hedysarum multijugum._--Quite hardy. An attractive shrub, with spikes
of reddish pea-like flowers in July and August. It increases freely from
the root by suckers. Thin and cut back the shoots in spring.

_Helianthemum vulgare_ (Rock Rose).--There are many garden varieties of
this, both double and single, the single sorts being the most
attractive. They are quite hardy on a warm and sunny rock garden.

_Hydrangea paniculata._--Hardy. A splendid low-growing shrub, flowering
in autumn. A group of this, with a few plants of _Prunus Pissardi_ cut
hard back every spring to keep them small, is very effective, and the
group can be carpeted with Lily of the Valley or London Pride to cover
the bare soil underneath. The shoots of the Hydrangea should be well
thinned, and those left cut hard back in the spring. It well repays a
dose or two of liquid manure in the growing season. The variety,
_grandiflora_, is better than the type.

_Hypericum calycinum_ (Rose of Sharon).--Grows well in half shade. It is
a dwarf plant, very pretty, but perhaps too often seen. Useful for
carpeting other shrubs.

_Jasminum nudiflorum._--Best on a wall. Winter flowering (yellow) and
very pretty when in bloom.

_Jasminum officinale._--Requires a wall, but does well while young. It
is not a very long-lived plant here.

_Kalmia latifolia._--Very attractive pink flowers; hardy, and will do
wherever Rhododendrons flourish.

_Kerria japonica._--A pretty yellow-flowered shrub that increases
rapidly from the root. The double-flowered variety is the most commonly
grown.

_Laburnum._--Too well known for description. _L. Adami_ is curious and
worth growing.

_Lavendula Spica._--The Lavender needs no description.

_Leycesteria formosa._--A good plant for a shady place. It grows well
under trees, and is very hardy.

_Ligustrum ovalifolium_ (Privet).--The golden form of this is good and
bright.

_Liriodendron tulipifera._--Grows well here, and is quite hardy, but
seldom flowers so far north.

_Lonicera periclymenum._--The common native Honeysuckle is an
indispensable climber, and will grow almost anywhere; but looks best,
perhaps, climbing up trees, or over shrubs or hedges. The variety,
_serotina_, flowers later than the type, and is best known under the
name of Late Dutch. _L. Sullivantii_ is a shrubby sort, with not
unattractive flowers of a brownish-orange colour.

_Magnolia._--The only one I have tried is _M. stellata_, which has
proved quite hardy, and I have no doubt that several others would do
quite as well in sheltered places.

_Neillia opulifolia_ (_Spiræa opulifolia_).--Quite hardy.

_Pernettya mucronata._--Does well.

_Pieris_ (_Andromeda_) _floribunda_.--Is quite hardy and very beautiful
early in the year. Will grow in soils that suit Rhododendrons.

_Potentilla fruticosa._--A little summer-flowering shrub, with yellow
flowers. It does well on the upper parts of the rock garden, and is
quite hardy.

_Prunus_ (_Cerasus_) _Mahaleb pendula_.--A very attractive little
weeping tree, with small white flowers in spring.

_Pyrus._--The following do well here: _Pyrus floribunda_, _P.
coronaria_, _P. lobata_ (syn. _Mespilus grandiflora_), and, of course,
the native Rowan tree (_P. Aucuparia_). The family of Apples enjoy a
well-drained place, being impatient of too much wet at the roots;
otherwise, their culture is of the simplest. They should be allowed to
grow as they will, only cutting out any branches that would be obviously
better away, and dead wood if any.

_Rhododendrons_ and _Azaleas_ luxuriate here. The common _R. ponticum_
sows itself in the woods. I have not yet tried the Himalayan
Rhododendrons, but from what I have seen of them in the Edinburgh
Botanic Gardens, which are much exposed to cold winds, I feel fairly
certain I could grow them here, where I can give them more protection.

_Rhodotypus kerrioides._--A very pretty hardy shrub, flowering on and
off all the summer. It has very clean white flowers, and from
appearances looks as though a cross with Kerria might be successful. The
Rhodotypus seeds freely here. It grows to a good size.

_Rhus Cotinus._--Another good shrub, attractive either in flower or
foliage, and the latter turns to a good colour in autumn.

_Ribes._--No garden should be without a plant of the Common Ribes. I
also grow _Aureum_ and a pale pinkish-white sort.

_Robinia hispida_ (Rose Acacia).--This is doing well in a corner
sheltered from the north, east, and west by evergreens.

_Roses._--The best that I grow as shrubs (in the garden sense) are the
Penzance Briars, _Rosa rugosa_ (Japanese Rose), Austrian Briars, _R.
spinosissima_, _Blairii II._, Charles Lawson, _R. macrantha_, _R.
alpina_, &c. These Roses stand up and make a good bush in a sheltered
place, without staking or any other trouble. Very little pruning is
needful, and that after the flowers are over, cutting out weak wood and
shortening some of the old shoots back to where young ones are breaking
vigorously.

_Rubus deliciosus._--Very pretty white flowers, large for a bramble. It
appears to be quite hardy, but is not a very strong grower.

_Ruscus aculeatus_ (Butcher's Broom).--An inconspicuous little shrub
that grows well under trees.

_Spartium junceum_ (Spanish Broom).--A good shrub for a sheltered bank;
it has spikes of bright-yellow flowers in July.

_Spiræa._--Most of the Spiræas do well here. The following are the best
of those I grow: _S. canescens_, very pretty habit of growth and
foliage; _S. discolor_ (_ariæfolia_), _S. japonica_ (vars. _alba_,
_Bumalda_, and Anthony Waterer), the last-mentioned very good. _S.
lindleyana_, a large grower, handsome both in flower and foliage. _S.
prunifolia fl. pl._ should be in all gardens; good both for flowers and
autumnal foliage. _S. Van Houttei_, very good. _Exochorda grandiflora_,
often known as _Spiræa grandiflora_, I have had since 1898, but though
it is now a large bush and very healthy, it has not yet made any attempt
to flower.

_Syringa_ (Lilacs).--These are indispensable. Some of the newer
varieties are good, such as Charles X., rosy lilac; Marie Legraye,
white; Souv. de L. Späth, reddish; Mme. Lemoine, double white. These
should always be procured on their own roots. Grafted plants seldom live
long.

_Veronica._--Several of the shrubby Veronicas do well. _V. Traversii_ is
the hardiest of all. In the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens there is a good
collection of these.

_Viburnum Opulus sterilis._--This, the well-known Snowball tree, and _V.
Tinus_ (_Laurustinus_), are the only two I have grown. Both do well, and
I fancy _V. plicatum_ and some others would do also. I shall try them.

_Vitis Coignetiæ._--I have this growing up the outer branches of a
Spanish Chestnut. It does not grow very fast, but is making steady
progress. It appears to be perfectly hardy, and its fine foliage turns
to a magnificent colour in autumn.


TREES AND SHRUBS IN EDINBURGH

Trees and shrubs that will thrive near Edinburgh will do so in almost
any exposed city or town similarly situated. Only those that have proved
adaptable to this windswept district have been included, an asterisk
being placed against the more beautiful and interesting species and
varieties that are happy in cold and windy gardens.


ACERS.--_A. Pseudo-platanus_ is the "Plane" of Scotland. Old trees form
features of great beauty. It reaches a height of 60 to 70 feet, often
less when isolated. _A. P. var. flavo-marginatum_*.--The original tree
of this variety still remains at Corstorphine, near Edinburgh. It is
very effective in spring, but the foliage becomes much duller during
summer. _A. P. purpureum._ _A. campestre_ (Common Maple). _A.
circinatum_*.--This is the most beautifully-coloured tree we have in
autumn. _A. platanoides_* (Norway Maple).--This is to be preferred to
either the Sycamore or Common Maple for planting in pleasure-grounds and
gardens. _A. dasycarpum._* _A. palmatum_*.--The varieties of this are
excellent although slow growing. _A. rubrum._ _A. pictum._ _A.
opulifolium obtusatum_*.--A bright tree in early spring with its
golden-green foliage and flowers. _A. saccharinum_ (Sugar Maple). _A.
japonicum_ and varieties.

ACTINIDIA KOLOMIKTA.--Climber; grows quickly on south wall.

HORSE CHESTNUT (_Æsculus Hippocastanum_) and others: _carnea_, _Pavia_,
_parviflora_, _flava_.

AILANTUS GLANDULOSA (Tree of Heaven).

AMELANCHIER VULGARIS and _A. canadensis_.*--Very ornamental. Seldom
seen, but as free-growing and flowering as the Hawthorn. The popular
name for these beautiful trees is Snowy Mespilus.

ARALIA SPINOSA and _A. chinensis_.*

ARBUTUS ANDRACHNE.--Flowers in February and March.

ARCTOSTAPHYLOS ALPINA.--Plenty of this found in north of Scotland, but
somewhat difficult to establish in gardens. _A. Uva-ursi._--Freer in
growth than the preceding. Both species are low-creeping shrubs suitable
for planting with Heaths in peat.

ARISTOLOCHIA SIPHO (Dutchman's Pipe).--Large effective climber.

ARTEMISIA ABROTANUM, _arborescens_, and _tridentata_.*--Useful shrubs of
grey tone.

AUCUBA JAPONICA and varieties.*

AZARA MICROPHYLLA* and _A. dentata_.

BERBERIS AQUIFOLIUM,* _Darwinii_, _vulgaris_, _nepalensis_. Single
specimens of _B. Aquifolium_, the Mahonia, become very ornamental with
age.

BETULA ALBA* (the Silver Birch).--A very hardy tree, beautiful both in
summer and winter. The pendulous variety is the best. Its branches are
proof against all winds. No tree is so well adapted for planting close
up to houses in the city, for it is very graceful, and obscures little
light. _B. utilis_, _B. papyrifera_, _B. populifolia_.

BOX* and varieties.

BRYANTHUS EMPETRIFORMIS.*--Very fine planted in broad masses. _B.
erectus_--Very beautiful in small beds.

CALYCANTHUS FLORIDUS.--This is excellent on walls.

CAMELLIAS only flower here on walls in the open. They form large bushes
in the grounds. _Camellia Thea_, the tea-plant, is also perfectly hardy.

CARMICHÆLIA FLAGELLIFORMIS.*--Very interesting, and flowering with great
freedom.

CARPENTERIA CALIFORNICA.*--A splendid plant for south walls, large
established specimens having a profusion of large white flowers.

CARPINUS BETULUS* (Hornbeam) and varieties.

CARYOPTERIS MASTACANTHUS.--A good wall plant.

CASSIOPE FASTIGIATA* and _C. tetragona_.*--Both are very choice subjects
here and flower well.

CASTANEA SATIVA* (Sweet or Spanish Chestnut).--Ornamental, but does not
ripen fruit here.

CEANOTHUS AMERICANUS and _veitchianus_.*--Splendid.

CERCIS SILIQUASTRUM* (Judas tree).

CHIMONANTHUS FRAGRANS (Winter-sweet).--Wall.

CHOISYA TERNATA (Mexican Orange Flower).

CISTUS.*--These are very fine, and flower for months if somewhat
sheltered.

CLEMATIS.--Of these very charming are _alpina_,* _apiifolia_,
_Flammula_,* _heracleæfolia_, _Vitalba_.*

COLLETIA CRUCIATA.

COLUTEA ARBORESCENS and _melanocalyx_.

CONVOLVULUS CNEORUM.*--Very pretty plant for a south wall; silvery
foliage and white flowers.

CORNUS (Dogwood).--Of these, _alba_ and varieties, _Kousa_, _florida_,
_sanguinea_ (very ornamental in winter), _Mas_ and _m. variegata_* (a
very choice, variegated shrub), are the best.

CORYLOPSIS PAUCIFLORA and _C. spicata_.--Both do well on a south wall.

CORYLUS (nut) AVELLANA _purpurea_.*--One of the most effective shrubs if
used carefully.

COTONEASTERS.--Of these, _buxifolia_, _Simonsii_, _thymifolia_,*
_microphylla_,* _horizontalis_* (a species with peculiar spreading flat
branches, producing a fine effect if grown on sloping banks), are the
most noteworthy.

HAWTHORN.--_Cratægus_ are valuable hardy trees, flowering at the end of
June to July; the scarlet form is brilliant.

[Illustration: _CYTISUS PRÆCOX (Spring)_]

CYTISUS (Broom).--Of this beautiful family, _albus_,* _Ardoini_,*
_biflorus_,* _decumbens_,* _nigricans_, _præcox_,* _purpureus_,*
_scoparius_ and varieties,* are all splendid growers for dry, sunny
situations.

DABOECIA.--_Polifolia_,* _alba_,* _bicolor_,* the Irish Heaths, are
beautiful in small beds and rockeries.

DAPHNE.--Of this delightful family, _blagayana_,* _Cneorum_,* _var.
majus_,* _Laureola_, _Mezereum_ and varieties.*

DEUTZIA GRACILIS* and _D. crenata_.

ELÆAGNUS ARGENTEA,* _E. multiflora_,* and _E. pungens_.*

EMPETRUM NIGRUM.*--This plant is useful for mixing with Heaths.

ENKIANTHUS HIMALAICUS.*--The finest species of the genus. Attractive.

[Illustration: _A VARIETY OF MAHALEB CHERRY (Prunus Mahaleb, var.
chrysocarpa)._]

HEATHS.--Of these, _E. carnea_,* _c. alba_,* _ciliaris_,* _cinerea_,*
_Mackaii_,* _mediterranea_,* _multiflora_, _stricta_,* _Tetralix_ and
varieties,* _vagans_ and varieties,* _Watsoni_.*

ERIOGONUM UMBELLATUM.--A very fine plant for covering banks.

ESCALLONIA.--Of these, _E. exoniensis_,* _macrantha_,* _philippiana_,*
are very valuable, either for walls or as small bushes.

EUCRYPHIA PINNATIFOLIA.*--A very beautiful but slow-growing hardy shrub.

EUONYMUS.--Of this family note should be made of _E. americanus_, _E.
europæus_, _E. radicans_.* The variegated and other forms of these
shrubs are very welcome.

EXOCHORDA GRANDIFLORA (Pearl Bush).

FABIANA IMBRICATA.*--A striking evergreen shrub for a wall.

FAGUS (Beech).--_F. ferruginea_ and _sylvatica_* and varieties.

FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA* and _F. viridissima_.

FRAXINUS EXCELSIOR* (the Ash), also the Manna Ash (_F. Ornus_).*

FUCHSIA RICCARTONI.*--Flowers for a very long time, and is very hardy.

GENISTA.--Of these, _G. anglica_, _hispanica_, _pilosa_, _sagittalis_,
_tinctoria_.

GLEDITSCHIA TRIACANTHOS.

HAMAMELIS (Witch or Wych Hazel).--_H. arborea_,* _japonica_,*
_virginica_.

HYDRANGEA PANICULATA.*--Magnificent when established.

HYPERICUM.--Of these, _H. Androsæmum_, _hookerianum_, _moserianum_* (the
best of the genus for small beds).

ILEX.--Of the Hollies, _I. Aquifolium_ and many varieties, _I.
cornuta_,* _I. Dahoon_,* _I. crenata_,* and _I. latifolia_* succeed
best.

JASMINES.--_J. fruticans_ and _J. nudiflorum_.* The last-named should be
grown as a small bush as well as on walls. Also _J. officinale_* and
varieties. A golden-leaved form of this species merits attention from
its foliage alone.

JUGLANS (Walnut) REGIA.--Grows fairly well, but no fruit of value.

LABURNUM.--Both _L. alpinum_ and _L. vulgare_.*

LAVENDER.

LEDUM.--Of this family, _L. latifolium_* and _L. palustre._*

LEUCOTHOË RECURVA.

LEYCESTERIA FORMOSA.

LIQUIDAMBAR STYRACIFLUA.*

LIRIODENDRON TULIPIFERA (Tulip tree*).--Grows into a very handsome tree.

LONICERA.--Of the Honeysuckles the best are _L. Caprifolium_,* _L.
fragrantissima_, _L. Periclymenum_,* _L. japonica_,* _L. Standishi_, _L.
Xylosteum_, _L. involucrata_.

LUPINUS ARBOREUS* and varieties (Tree Lupine).--Best on walls.

MAGNOLIAS.--Of these, _M. acuminata_,* the Cucumber tree, flowers
freely. _M. grandiflora_* is only for sheltered walls, and _M. Fraseri_,
_M. conspicua_, _M. stellata_, _M. Watsoni_* for sheltered places.

MORUS NIGRA (Black Mulberry) and _M. alba_.

OLEARIA HAASTII.*--The best August flowering shrub. _O. macrodonta_ and
_stellulata_.*

OSMANTHUS AQUIFOLIUM.*

PERNETTYA MUCRONATA.*--Effective both in flower and berry.

PHILADELPHUS (Mock Orange).--_P. coronarius_* and varieties and
_microphyllus_.

PHLOMIS FRUTICOSA.

PIERIS FLORIBUNDA.*--Very free flowering. _P. japonica
variegata_*--Effective.

PLATANUS ACERIFOLIA (Plane).--This appears hardy, but is not popular. It
is slower in growth than most trees.

POPULUS (Poplar).--_P. alba_, _P. balsamifera_ (Balsam Poplar), _P.
nigra_ (Black Poplar), and _P. tremula_.

POTENTILLA FRUTICOSA* (Shrubby Cinquefoil).--Well deserves more
attention.

PRUNUS.--Of these, the Cherry and Bird Cherry,* Plum,* Bullace,* and the
beautiful _P. triloba_ are a success.

PTELEA TRIFOLIATA.

PYRUS.--_P. Aria_* (the White Beam tree), _P. Aucuparia_* (Mountain
Ash), _P. japonica_,* _P. rotundifolia_,* _P. Sorbus_* (Service tree).

QUERCUS (Oak).--The most satisfactory species are _Q. sessilifolia_,*
and _Q. pedunculata_. These generally thrive well and are amongst the
most beautiful of trees for large gardens. In poor soil and windswept
places the British Oaks do not grow more than about 40 feet in height,
but develop into picturesque features. Their foliage here is of a
pleasing green when that of the Beech and Sycamore is past its best.
Very few acorns are produced. _Q. Cerris_,* the Turkey Oak, and its
variety _laciniata_,* and _Q. lucombeana_,* are also beautiful trees. We
must also mention the Evergreen Oak (_Q. Ilex_),* _alba_, _palustris_,
_laurifolia_, _coccinea_ (Scarlet Oak), _Suber_ (Cork Oak), _conferta_.

RHODODENDRON.--Of the Rhododendrons the following are satisfactory: _R.
altaclerense_, _Anthopogon_, _arborescens_, _arboreum Campbelliæ_,
_azaleoides_, _blandyanum_, _calendulaceum_, _campanulatum_,
_campylocarpum_, _catawbiense_, _caucasicum_,* _ciliatum_,
_cinnabarinum_,* _ferrugineum_,* _fulgens_, _glaucum_,* _hirsutum_* and
varieties, _indicum balsaminæflorum_, _lancifolium_, _lepidotum_,*
_myrtifolium_,* _nobleanum_,* _n. album_,* _ponticum_* (many varieties),
_præcox_,* _punctatum_, _racemosum_, _Rhodora_, _sinensis_* (_Azalea
mollis_), _Vaseyi_,* _Wilsoni_. These are the principal Rhododendrons
that thrive and flower well here. No other shrubs give such a long and
varied flower display.

RIBES.--_R. alpinum_, _aureum_, and _rubrum_. _R. sanguineum_* and its
varieties are the principal ornamental currants.

ROBINIA PSEUDACACIA.*--An elegant foliage tree, and usually the last to
break into leaf.

ROSA.--Practically all the Tea and Hybrid Perpetual Roses can be grown,
if sheltered spots are chosen and the plants grown as dwarfs. However,
the stronger varieties are the most satisfactory ones, and in bad
seasons it is July before they commence to flower, although September
has well advanced before they cease. The hybrid Sweet Briars are the
freest of all to grow. Groups form thickets of foliage which are almost
hidden with blossom. _Rosa wichuraiana_ covers banks, or anything
somewhat flat, in a very short time. It flowers through September, and
attracts great attention. Such tender Roses as Maréchal Niel, Niphetos,
and Banksian are useless.

ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS (Rosemary).

RUBUS.--Of these, _R. arcticus_, dwarf; _R. lacinatus_,* _R. nutkanus_.*
_R. deliciosus_* is a beautiful shrub, and should be left alone after
planting.

RUSCUS (Butcher's Broom).--_R. aculeatus_ and _R. Hypoglossum_.

SALIX (Willow).--_S. alba_, _babylonica_ (Babylonian Willow), and
_pendula_, a lovely tree. _S. Caprea_* (Goat Willow), _fragilis_,
_herbacea_ (the Alpine Willow, not much larger than the Wild Thyme),
_Lapponum_, _nigra_, _Paulinæ_, _reticulata_, _rubra_, _viminalis_.

SAMBUCUS (Elder).--_S. canadensis_, _nigra_, _racemosus_.

SKIMMIA FORTUNEI and _S. japonica_.*

SPIRÆAS.--Of these, _S. bella_, _bullata_, _canescens_, _decumbens_,
_cantoniensis_,* _discolor_,* _japonica_, _var. Bumalda_,* _tomentosa_,
_var. alba_.

STAPHYLEA COLCHICA.

SYMPHORICARPUS RACEMOSUS (Snowberry).

SYRINGA (Lilac).--_S. persica_* (Persian Lilac), and _S. vulgaris_* and
varieties.

TAMARIX.--_T. gallica_, _T. hispida_, and _T. odessana_,* a very fine
August flowering shrub.

TILIA (Lime).--_T. argentea_, _T. cordata_, _T. platyphyllos_, and _T.
vulgaris_,* the best of all.

ULEX (Furze).--_U. europæus_ and _var. fl. pl._*

ULMUS (Elm).--_U. campestris_* and _U. montana_.*

VACCINIUMS.--Of these choose _V. arboreum_, _V. corymbosum_, _V.
Myrtillus_, and _V. pennsylvanicum_,* very fine for drooping over rocks
in rock garden; _V. Vitis-idæa_ and the variety _variegata_, a pretty
variety of this native shrub.

VERONICA.--Of these the most satisfactory are _V. amplexicaulis_,*
_Armstrongii_,* _buxifolia_,* _chathamica_,* _Colensoi_,*
_cupressoides_,* _c. variabilis_*--grown in poor soil and well exposed,
this variety of _V. cupressoides_ is very fine both in summer and
winter--_decumbens_,* _epacridea_,* _glauco-cærulea_,* _Hectori_,*
_Kirkii_,* _ligustrifolia_,* _monticola_,* _pimeleoides_,*
_pinguifolia_,* _rakaiensis_,* _salicifolia_,* _Traversii_.* The above
are hardy Veronicas. They also happily include many of the best.
Other species are good plants out of doors during summer; they are,
however, best lifted early in October and housed till May, or they may
be covered in severe weather. Cold winds do most mischief.

[Illustration: _GUELDER ROSE OR SNOWBALL TREE._]

VIBURNUM OPULUS (Guelder Rose) and varieties, _V. O. sterilis_,* and _V.
tomentosum plicatum_.*

VINCA (Periwinkle).--_V. major_* and _V. minor_* and varieties.

VITIS (Vines).--Of these the best are _V. Coignetiæ_,* _V.
heterophylla_,* _V. Labrusca_,* and _V. riparia_.*

YUCCA.--_Y. acutifolia_, _Y. filamentosa_,* and _Y. gloriosa_.*

BAMBOOS.--These require sheltered positions and good deep soil. The
following have proved to be the best out of a considerable number:
_Arundinaria auricoma_,* _Fortunei_,* _var. variegata_,* _falcata_,*
_Hindsii_,* _japonica_,* _nitida_,* _pumila_,* _Veitchii_,* _Simoni
variegata_,* _Bambusa palmata_,* _B. tessellata_,* _Phyllostachys
aurea_,* _Henonis_,* _boryana_,* _flexuosa_,* _mitis_,* _nigra_,*
_Quiloi_,* _viridi-glaucescens_.*

[Illustration: _WYCH ELMS BY HEDGEROW._]

CONIFERS.--These are only useful when young--at least, the majority of
them. It is impossible to keep them symmetrical against strong cold
winds, and the deposits of soot upon their foliage are injurious.

When Conifers are wished for as large trees, the Cedar of Lebanon,
Atlantic Cedar, _Pinus sylvestris_, _Pinus Pinaster_, or _Cupressus
lawsoniana_ are suitable.

When Abies and Picea lose their symmetry they are usually far from
ornamental. All the species and beautiful varieties of Cupressus, Thuya,
and Juniperus are very valuable in a young state. They should be
replaced as they become thin and shabby, as they soon do in exposed
places. The most satisfactory tree of all is the Yew. Even this hardy
tree has its foliage badly hurt by severe winds, but the damage is soon
made good.




CHAPTER XXIV

TENDER SHRUBS AND TREES IN THE SOUTH-WEST[1]


The possibilities that exist of the successful open-air culture of
tender subjects in the south-west are but little dreamt of by the
majority of English flower-lovers. They doubtless read with interest the
accounts in the horticultural press of Australian, Chilian, and
Californian flowering trees and shrubs growing in their native habitats,
and possibly feel a desire to visit these climes in order that they may
verify with their own eyes the truth of their readings. As a matter of
fact, however, a lengthy sea-voyage is by no means indispensable in
order to view certain of these exotics flourishing in the open air, for
a few hours' journey by rail will bring the passenger to a land where
many of these denizens of other climes may be seen enjoying robust
health under English skies.

The following list of tender shrubs and trees growing in the gardens of
the south-west cannot claim to be an exhaustive one, since it contains
only such as have been personally noticed in good health during rambles
along the southern coast-line of Cornwall and Devon, and, where no
lengthened inspection is possible, it is obvious that certain species
and varieties must be overlooked. Incomplete, however, as it doubtless
is, it should give an idea of the climatic advantages enjoyed by the
district in question.

Many of the subjects mentioned are growing in Tresco Abbey gardens,
Isles of Scilly, but most of these are also found in mainland gardens as
well. Where any have been met with at Tresco only, the fact is noted,
but these may also be present on the mainland.

The soil of the Scillies, which is composed apparently of peat and
disintegrated granite, and is almost identical with much of that around
Penzance, is admirably adapted for hard-wooded Australian, New Zealand,
and Chilian shrubs and trees, and almost all the species and genera
enumerated would be best suited by a compost in which peat and
leaf-mould and granite sand formed the chief proportion, although it
must be allowed that some alluded to have been found to succeed equally
well in sandy loam. Porosity in the soil is indispensable, for, in this
district, where the winter rains are often exceptionally heavy, unless
the water percolates rapidly through the ground, stagnant moisture
collects around the roots, a condition which is absolutely fatal to
success. The advantages of the Cornish granite sand are gradually being
appreciated. Mr. Fitzherbert writes, "I was told the other day by an
acquaintance that since he had imported it by the truck-load to his
Sussex garden he was able to grow many things successfully that he had
before failed with."

ABELIA FLORIBUNDA.--Mexico. A beautiful evergreen shrub, bearing
clusters of drooping pink flowers about 3 inches in length. Requires a
sunny and sheltered site. Finest specimen 6 feet. Several gardens.

ABUTILON VEXILLARIUM.--Rio Grande. A handsome evergreen species
generally grown against a wall. It throws up long, slender, arching
shoots from 6 to 8 feet in length, studded with pendulous ball-shaped
flowers with crimson sepals, yellow petals, and dark-brown stamens which
are very striking and often remain in bloom for six months. Common. _A.
vitifolium_--Chili. A most ornamental evergreen shrub of which there are
two forms, one bearing lavender flowers, the other white. In exceptional
cases it attains a height of 20 feet, and when covered with its large
blossoms, which are about 3 inches in diameter, and feathered to the
ground with foliage, it presents a lovely picture. Large specimens form
pyramids of bloom, and in some gardens numbers of these are to be found.
Wall protection unnecessary.

ACACIAS.--Australia. In Cornish and South Devon gardens many species are
to be met with in robust health. _A. affinis_, very generally confounded
with _A. dealbata_, is the most common. In many cases _A. affinis_ is
grown as _A. dealbata_. The leaves of the former are green, while those
of the latter are bluish and its flowers are less bright in colour. A
group of _A. affinis_ about 35 feet in height was a wonderful sight at
Tregothnan at the end of March, being simply covered with golden blossom
which was thrown into high relief by a background of Ilexes. _A.
verticillata_ is another handsome species flowering later in the spring.
It is a very rapid grower, reaching a height of 15 feet in a few years,
generally growing in the form of a broad-based cone, with its lower
branches but a foot or so from the ground. When in flower it is so
covered with its pale-yellow blossoms that no foliage is discernible.
_A. armata_ may be seen as a bush 7 feet high and as much in diameter.
_A. ovata_ Mr. Fitzherbert has only seen as a bush some 3 feet high;
very pretty when bearing its circular, golden flower-bells. _A.
longifolia_ is another handsome tree, with leaves something like those
of an Oleander and bright-yellow flowers. _A. melanoxylon_ is a fine
tree. The specimen at Tresco is about 50 feet in height, and there are
good examples on the mainland. Pale-yellow flowers produced in
profusion. Other species met with are _A. riceana_, _A. (Albizzia)
lophantha_, _A. calamifolia_, _A. linifolia_, _A. latifolia_, and _A.
platyptera_, the latter against a wall.

ADENANDRA FRAGRANS.--Cape of Good Hope. A small evergreen shrub, bearing
fragrant, rose-coloured flowers. Tregothnan.

ANOPTERUS GLANDULOSA.--Tasmania. A vigorous evergreen shrub, with dark,
shining green leaves, bearing long, erect terminal racemes of white,
cup-shaped flowers, resembling the blooms of _Clethra arborea_, but
larger. Tregothnan.

ACANTHOPANAX SPINOSUM.--Garden seedling. A striking plant with
dark-green, large-sized leaves divided into five sections. Height at
present 5 feet. Tregothnan.

ASTER (OLEARIA) ARGOPHYLLUS.--Australia. The Silver Musk tree, with
musk-scented leaves and dull-red flowers in summer. Three gardens.
Height 12 feet.

ATHROTAXIS LAXIFOLIA.--Tasmania. A tender Conifer. A fine example, 20
feet in height, fruited profusely at Menabilly two years ago.

BANKSIA GRANDIS.--Australia. Evergreen shrub, bearing yellow flowers in
dense spikes. _B. serrata_, red flowers, and _B. littoralis_. All at
Tresco. _B. quercifolia_, handsome leaves, with white reverse.
Abbotsbury. Banksias were at one time in request as greenhouse plants.

BAUERA RUBIOIDES.--New South Wales. A pretty little evergreen shrub not
unlike a Heath, but more branching, bearing solitary, pink,
saucer-shaped flowers half an inch across, each petal striped with white
down the centre.

BENTHAMIA (CORNUS CAPITATA) FRAGIFERA.--Nepaul. A handsome, evergreen
tree, first introduced into England in 1825, when seed was sown at
Heligan, Cornwall, and where there are now specimens some 60 feet in
height. It is largely represented throughout Cornwall, being used in
some places as a woodland tree. In June, when the leafage is hidden by
the wide-spread, platter-like flowers of pale yellow, its effect is very
beautiful, especially when thrown up by a background of green foliage.
In the autumn the fruits, from which it takes its name of Strawberry
tree, some an inch or more in diameter, become bright crimson.

BORONIA.--Australia. These are almost universally treated as greenhouse
plants, but succeed in the open air in the south-west. At Tregothnan, at
the end of March, two bushes of _B. megastigma_, planted in front of a
wall, the larger of which was about 3 feet in height, were coming into
profuse bloom, and already scented the air with the first of their
brown, yellow-lined, drooping cups. _B. heterophylla_, with its
purple-red flowers was also expanding blooms, and _B. Drummondii_, _B.
elatior_, and _B. polygalæfolia_ were also growing in the same garden.

BRACHYGLOTTIS REPANDA.--New Zealand. A handsome tree, with leaves nearly
a foot in length and numerous minute flower-heads. Tresco.

BUDDLEIA COLVILLEI.--Sikkim. The finest of the new race, with pendulous
racemes, nearly a foot in length, of crimson, pentstemon-like flowers,
paler round the centre, an inch across. Leaves large and dark green, 6
inches or more in length. Several gardens.

CALLISTEMON SALIGNUS.--Australia. There are two forms of this
Bottle-brush, one bearing pale-yellow flowers and the other crimson.
Others are _C. lanceolatus_, carmine-flowered, and _C. speciosus_,
scarlet-flowered. These grow well as bushes, specimens of the
first-named being sometimes 10 feet in height and as much in diameter.
There is much confusion between this genus and _Metrosideros
floribunda_. Callistemons are to be found in many gardens.

CAMELLIA RETICULATA.--This is hardy, but rarely flowers satisfactorily
in the open except in the south-west, where it is grown both against
walls and as a bush plant. It is by far the finest of the Camellias,
bearing lovely, pink, semi-double flowers 6 inches in diameter, with
bright-yellow, spreading stamens.

CANDOLLEA TETRANDRA.--Australia. An evergreen bush bearing clear-yellow,
cup-shaped flowers somewhat resembling Sun Roses, but of finer texture.
Tresco.

CANTUA BUXIFOLIA.--Peru. An evergreen shrub, bearing in corymbs at the
end of the branches pale-red trumpet-flowers something after the style
of _Fuchsia corymbiflora_. Tresco.

CARPENTERIA CALIFORNICA.--A well-known evergreen shrub in the
south-west, bearing fragrant, white, yellow-centred flowers. In some
gardens it suffers from browning of the leaves, but this is apparently
not the effect of cold winds or frost, as often the most exposed plants
are the least affected and the most sheltered are in the worst plight.
The finest specimen known to Mr. Fitzherbert is about 8 feet high and as
much through; it is growing near Teignmouth. It may be considered fairly
hardy since it has been grown in the open in Scotland.

CARYOPTERIS MASTACANTHUS.--Chili. A most valuable, much-branched
evergreen shrub growing to a height of 4 feet or more, bearing
lavender-blue clusters of flowers in October. There is also a white
form. The type is common. This is also happy farther north.

CASSINIA LEPTOPHYLLA.--New Zealand. A small evergreen shrub, bearing
white flower-heads. Tregothnan.

CEANOTHUS.--California and Mexico. Many species and varieties are grown
both as bushes, in which form they soon make small trees, and trained
against walls. Of the early-flowering varieties _C. veitchianus_ is the
brightest coloured, and of the autumn-blooming, azureus section, Gloire
de Versailles is the favourite. Common in most gardens.

CITHAREXYLOM QUADRANGULARE.--West Indies. The Fiddle-wood. Bears white,
fragrant flowers. There is a fine specimen at Abbotsbury. Dorset.

CITRUS TRIFOLIATA (OEGLE SEPIARIA).--Japan. This fiercely-spined
Citrus is hardy, but rarely flowers and fruits in the north. In the
south-west it flowers freely, and one specimen fruits almost annually.
It is 7 feet in height, and last year carried over thirty fruits.

CLERODENDRON TRICHOTOMUM.--Japan. A deciduous shrub, also hardy, but
flowering best in the south-west. A fine specimen over 15 feet in height
and as much through is at Greenway on the Dart.

CLETHRA ARBOREA.--Madeira. The Lily-of-the-Valley tree. Evergreen. It
bears panicles of white, bell-shaped flowers in the summer, at which
time it is quite a feature at Tresco. There are good bushes, the
largest about 7 feet in height, at Trewidden, near Penzance.

COROKIA BUDDLEIOIDES.--New Zealand. A tall-growing evergreen shrub, with
leaves 2 to 6 inches in length. _C. Cotoneaster_ is a spreading shrub
with small leaves. Both species bear yellow, sweet-scented flowers. The
first was at Ludgvan Rectory, Cornwall, the second at Bishop's Teignton.
South Devon.

CORREA.--Australia. Greenhouse evergreen shrubs which do well at Tresco,
and also in some gardens on the mainland. _C. cardinalis_ is the most
brilliant, but _C. ventricosa_ is almost as highly coloured. The two
named, as well as _C. alba_, _C. bicolor_, _C. carnea_, _C. glauca_, _C.
magnifica_, and _C. virens_ are sometimes seen in good health and flower
on the mainland.

CORYNOCARPUS LÆVIGATUS.--New Zealand. An evergreen tree, bearing
panicles of white flowers followed by plum-like fruit. A healthy young
plant is at Ludgvan Rectory.

CRINODENDRON HOOKERI (TRICUSPIDARIA HEXAPETALA).--Chili. A particularly
handsome shrub, growing to a height of 5 feet, bearing large, drooping,
cherry-red, urn-shaped flowers on long peduncles, the petals being very
fine in texture. In many gardens.

CYTISUS RACEMOSUS.--Peak of Teneriffe. One of the commonest and most
popular greenhouse plants. It grows to 8 or 10 feet in height in the
south-west and often flowers until Christmas.

DAPHNE INDICA.--India. Both the white and purple-red form of this
fragrant plant are common in the open in Devon and Cornwall, and in mild
seasons commence to bloom in January. Some old plants have formed large
bushes in front of walls.

DAPHNIPHYLLUM GLAUCESCENS.--China. Evergreen. This is hardy, but is
uncommon. A very large specimen is at Trewidden, and is 12 feet in
height and 20 feet in spread. It has long shining leaves, the shoots
being red in colour; these, early in April, are surrounded by closely
clustered, maroon-red flower-buds.

DATURA SANGUINEA.--Peru. This grows to a large size in the south-west,
often forming a tree 12 feet or more in height, and, in mild winters,
blooming until February. _D. suaveolens_, Mexico, is probably more
tender, as such large specimens are rarely seen.

DENDROMECON RIGIDUS.--California. A handsome shrub with glaucous leaves,
the branchlets terminated by bright-yellow poppy-like flowers. It
succeeds best in poor soil that does not induce vigorous growth. Enys.

DESFONTAINEA SPINOSA.--Chili. A most distinct evergreen shrub, with
leaves resembling those of a Holly. It bears tubular flowers 3 inches in
length of a bright vermilion tipped with yellow, and is a very handsome
object when in full flower. It commences to bloom in the summer, and
often holds many of its flowers until November. The largest specimen met
with was about 8 feet in height, and was in the neighbourhood of
Teignmouth. The Desfontainea is to be found in most gardens.

DIOSMA ERICOIDES.--South Africa. A heath-like evergreen shrub, bearing
single white flowers not unlike those of a Myrtle. Its leaves are
fragrant when bruised. A healthy plant, about 4 ft. by 4 ft., trained
against a wall, was coming into bloom at Tregothnan at the end of March.

DIOSPYROS KAKI.--The Persimmon. China. This is hardy, but rarely fruits
except in the south-west. A tree at Bishop's Teignton produced fruit,
which ripened well, in 1890. In autumn the colouring of its foliage is
very attractive.

DRIMYS (TASMANNIA) AROMATICA.--Tasmania. An evergreen shrub or small
tree, bearing tiny white flowers in spring. Its leaves, if bitten, are
very pungent, stinging the palate like pepper. The finest specimen known
to the writer is one 15 feet in height at Menabilly. _D. Winteri_--South
America. A handsome flowering shrub, bearing ivory-yellow, fragrant
flowers, an inch across. At Bishop's Teignton there is a good example
over 12 feet in height. Both species are fairly well distributed in
gardens.

DRYOBALANOPS AROMATICA.--Sumatra. The Camphor tree. There is at
Penjerrick a good specimen 20 feet in height.

EDWARDSIA GRANDIFLORA SYN. SOPHORA TETRAPTERA.--The New Zealand
Laburnum. This and its variety _E. microphylla_ bear racemes of yellow
flowers, the individual blooms being 2 inches long in the first case,
and about half the length in the second, in the spring. Examples 10 feet
or so in height are to be found in some gardens.

[Illustration: _EDWARDSIA GRANDIFLORA._]

EMBOTHRIUM COCCINEUM.--South America. The Fire Bush. The most brilliant
of all flowering trees capable of outdoor culture in this country. In
May every twig is laden with clusters of long flowers of glowing
scarlet, the trees presenting a most gorgeous spectacle. Every good
garden in Cornwall and most in South Devon possesses specimens, some
containing a dozen or more. The finest are probably Trewidden and
Penjerrick, where they are 30 feet in height and as much in spread.

ERIOSTEMON BUXIFOLIUS.--Australia. A small evergreen shrub, bearing pink
flowers in the spring. Tresco.

ESCALLONIA ILLINITA.--Chili. Bears white flowers in July. There is one
15 feet high at Menabilly. _E. revoluta_--Chili. Bears white flowers
three quarters of an inch long in August, 20 feet high. Menabilly. _E.
organensis_--Organ Mountains. Bears rose-coloured flowers. Fine
specimens in more than one garden. _E. floribunda_--Montevideo. Bears
fragrant white flowers in August. Common in the south-west.

EUCALYPTI.--Australia. Some thirty or forty specimens are grown, of
which perhaps the best known are: _E. globulus_, which has attained a
height of 50 feet; _E. citriodora_, 20 feet, against the house at
Togerthnan; _E. amygdalina_, &c. Many flower freely and bear fertile
seed. _E. Gunnii_ flowers freely at Parkstone, Dorset, in Professor
Wallace's garden. It is quite hardy there.

EUCRYPHIA PINNATIFOLIA.--Chili. A beautiful deciduous flowering shrub,
bearing large white flowers like a St. John's Wort, with bright-yellow
anthers. A specimen at Trewidden is 8 feet in height.

EUONYMUS FIMBRIATUS.--Japan and India. This shrub is chiefly remarkable
for the tint of its young leafage, which is bright crimson, and gives a
vivid, flower-like effect at a little distance in April. Met with at
Tregothnan and Abbotsbury.

EUPATORIUM WEINMANNIANUM.--South America. This soon grows into a rounded
bush 10 feet or so in height and as much in diameter. It bears its flat
heads of fragrant white flowers in autumn and well into winter, the
flowers being succeeded by fluffy seed-vessels. It is quite common.

EURYA LATIFOLIA.--Japan. Half-hardy. An evergreen shrub, with leaves
somewhat like those of a Camellia, bearing small white flowers. There is
a variegated form that at one time was used for greenhouse decoration.
Tresco.

FABIANA IMBRICATA.--Chili. A charming evergreen heath-like shrub,
bearing a profusion of pure-white tubular flowers clustered thickly
around every shoot. A fine example 8 feet in height is at Trelissick,
but it is a common plant in the south-west.

[Illustration: _FABIANA IMBRICATA IN FLOWER IN A DEVONSHIRE GARDEN._]

FAGUS CLIFFORTIOIDES.--The New Zealand Beech. A tree with minute leaves,
which have given it the name of Birch in its native land. In New
Zealand it is evergreen, but in this country is deciduous. A good
specimen is at Enys.

FREMONTIA CALIFORNICA.--An extremely handsome deciduous flowering shrub,
bearing bright-yellow, cupped flowers 3 inches in diameter with orange
stamens. It often remains in bloom for months. Large plants have
unfortunately a way of dying off when apparently in good health, several
fine specimens having succumbed in this manner. The finest we now know
of is one growing in bush form about 8 feet in height at Newton Abbot,
but the same garden contained at one time a larger example.

GREVILLEA.--Australia. _G. rosmarinifolia_, with carmine-red flowers,
forms a vigorous shrub, growing to a height of 8 feet with a spread of 7
feet. It is to be found in many gardens. At Tregothnan, _G. Priessii_,
with pink and yellow flowers; _G. alpina_, red-tipped yellow; and _G.
sulphurea_ are grown; and we have seen _G. robusta_, which had been in
the open for three years. All species are evergreen.

GUEVINA AVELLANA.--Chili. A very ornamental evergreen tree, with large
impari-pinnate leaves of a deep, glossy green, bearing white flowers
followed by coral-red fruit the size of a cherry. There is a fine
specimen at Greenway, 20 feet in height, which has ripened fruits from
which seedlings have been raised.

HABROTHAMNUS CORYMBOSUS.--Mexico. This well-known red-flowered
greenhouse shrub does admirably as a bush plant in the open, as does _H.
elegans_, with purple-red flowers. They often carry bloom as late as
November and are frequently met with.

HAKEA LAURINA.--Australia. An evergreen shrub, bearing clusters of
rosy-lilac flowers. Menabilly. Mr. Fitzherbert says, "I am not aware if
it has flowered in this country."

HELIOCARPUS CYANEUS.--Tropical America. A small evergreen tree, bearing
blue flowers. Tresco.

HOHERIA POPULNEA.--New Zealand. The Houhere of the natives. Ribbon-wood.
With pure white flowers and a handsome foliage. Enys and other gardens.

ILLICIUM ANISATUM.--Japan. A half-hardy evergreen shrub, bearing
clusters of ivory-white flowers. Held sacred by the Japanese, who burn
the bark before the shrines of their deities. Tresco. _I. floridanum_,
Southern States of America, bearing maroon flowers. Not uncommon.

INDIGOFERA GERARDIANA.--India. A low-branching evergreen shrub, with
finely-divided foliage, bearing racemes 5 inches in length of
rose-purple, pea-like flowers. Common. There is a white variety which is
rarely seen.

JACARANDA MIMOSÆFOLIA.--Brazil. A very graceful evergreen tree with
acacia-like leaves a foot in length, bearing panicles of drooping
violet-blue flowers. There is a fine young plant at Rosehill, Falmouth.

LAGERSTROEMIA INDICA.--A handsome deciduous shrub, bearing large
bright-pink flowers.

LEPTOSPERMUM.--Australia. _L. baccatum_ and _L. scoparium_ are the most
generally met with. Both bear small white flowers and are evergreen.
We have seen the former 12 feet and the latter 20 feet in height. Other
species are also grown.

LIBONIA FLORIBUNDA.--Brazil. The favourite greenhouse flowering shrub,
bearing drooping scarlet and yellow blossoms. Tresco and one mainland
garden.

LITSEA GENICULATA.--Southern United States. A deciduous shrub or tree,
bearing white flowers in May. The largest in England is probably one at
Menabilly, 25 feet in height.

MELALEUCA HYPERICIFOLIA.--Australia. An evergreen shrub, bearing scarlet
bottle-brush flowers. Tresco.

MELIA AZEDARACH.--Tropical Asia. The Bead tree, so called from the seeds
being used for rosaries, bearing much-branched panicles of fragrant
lilac flowers. Leaves bipinnate and deeply serrated. Rosehill.
Evergreen.

MELIANTHUS MAJOR.--Cape of Good Hope. A well-known plant in sub-tropical
gardening. At Rosehill it has reached a height of 12 feet.

METROSIDEROS ROBUSTA.--New Zealand. An evergreen tree, bearing clusters
of brilliant crimson flowers at the extremities of the shoots; in this
it differs from Callistemon, whose flowers encircle the branchlets some
distance below the extremities. Tresco; 30 feet in height.

MITRARIA COCCINEA.--Chili. An evergreen shrub, bearing bright-scarlet
flowers. This is to be found 6 feet in some gardens.

MYOPORUM LÆTUM.--Australia. Native name, Guaio. An evergreen tree,
bearing small white flowers, and having lanceolate leaves dotted with
countless transparent spots. Two mainland gardens.

NERIUM OLEANDER.--Mediterranean. The Oleander. This is established, and
flowers in sheltered nooks on the mainland.

OZOTHAMNUS ROSMARINIFOLIUS.--Australia. An evergreen shrub, bearing
countless, minute, white flowers. Sprays, if cut when the flowers are
fully expanded, will retain their decorative qualities for a year. It is
common in the south-west, and at Trewidden there are bushes 8 feet in
height.

PAULOWNIA IMPERIALIS.--Japan. A hardy deciduous flowering tree, bearing
erect panicles of large, lilac, gloxinia-like flowers. Owing to the
spring frosts, it rarely perfects these except in sheltered sites in
mild springs, but when in good bloom it is marvellously beautiful.

PENTSTEMON CORDIFOLIUS.--California. A tall-growing species, bearing
bright-scarlet flowers in the summer. With the shelter of a wall it
grows to a height of 5 feet or more. Trewidden.

PHILESIA BUXIFOLIA.--Chili. A dwarf evergreen shrub, rarely exceeding 2
feet in height, bearing drooping, pink lapageria-like blossoms. To be
found in many gardens.

PHOTINIA JAPONICA.--Japan. The Loquat. This hardy, ornamental-foliaged
tree is practically hardy, and at Enys flowers annually. We believe,
however, that it has not fruited. The finest specimen we know of, 15
feet in height with a head 12 feet through, is at Saltram.

PIERIS FORMOSA.--Himalayas. This so-called Andromeda is widely met with.
The finest example is at Pentillie Castle, and is 20 feet in height with
a spread of 30 feet. When this is white with its clustering
flower-sprays it is a lovely sight.

PIMELEA DECUSSATA.--Australia. An evergreen shrub, bearing rose-red,
globular flower-heads at the extremities of the branches. Tresco.

PINUS MONTEZUMÆ.--Mexico. A noble and distinct Pine, good specimens of
which are at Tregothnan and Menabilly, where it has fruited.

[Illustration: _PINUS MONTEZUMÆ AT FOTA._]

PIPTANTHUS NEPALENSIS.--Nepaul. An evergreen shrub, bearing numbers of
bright-yellow laburnum-like flowers. It seems indifferent to soil, and
may be seen flourishing under adverse circumstances. Common.

PLAGIANTHUS BETULINUS.--New Zealand. Ribbon tree. Bears small white
flowers in clusters. A splendid example 50 feet in height is at
Abbotsbury.

PITTOSPORUM.--New Zealand. Evergreen shrubs. _P. Mayi_, at Tregothnan,
is about 30 feet in height; while we have seen _P. bicolor_ over 20
feet, and many fine examples of _P. undulatum_, _P. tenuifolium_, of
which last a hedge has been made at Falmouth, and other species. All
bear their little flowers in profusion in the south-west. The Japanese
_P. Tobira_ is a hardy shrub, bearing spreading flower-heads of fragrant
white blossom.

PODOCARPUS ANDINA.--Chili. A handsome evergreen tree to be found in most
gardens. At Penjerrick there is a specimen 40 feet in height.

POINCIANA (CÆSALPINA) GILLIESI.--South America. An evergreen shrub with
acacia-like foliage, bearing clusters of large yellow flowers with
bright-red stamens. Mr. Fitzherbert says, "The finest specimen I have
seen was in the late Rev. H. Ewbank's garden at Ryde, but I know of
smaller ones in the south-west."

POLYGALA GRANDIFOLIA (syns. _grandis_, &c.).--Bahia. An evergreen
flowering shrub, the finest of its race, bearing large rose and white
flowers. Tregothnan.

PSEUDOPANAX CRASSIFOLIUM.--New Zealand. An evergreen shrub with
dark-green thick leaves 2 feet in length, with orange midribs. Ludgvan
Rectory.

PUNICA GRANATUM.--The Pomegranate is a neglected shrub in English
gardens. Planted at the foot of a south wall, and treated generally like
a well-groomed Peach tree, it will flower from June to September. It is
not a shrub for cold climates, but Mr. Watson, writing in the _Garden_,
October 26, p. 283, says, "At Kew three varieties are grown outdoors,
namely, the type, the big double-white flowered variety, with petals
margined with white, Picotee-like, and the dwarf variety known as Nana.
There are other forms beside these, including a white-flowered one which
I have seen in Paris gardens, where old--very old--standard plants are
grown and treasured. The dwarf variety is cultivated as a pot plant in
some continental countries. I have seen it in the Hamburg florists'
shops, pretty little pyramids in 5-inch pots, covered with flowers.
Fruits are rarely produced by the Pomegranate in England."

RHAPITHAMNUS CYANOCARPUS.--Chili. An evergreen tree, bearing pale-blue
flowers, followed by violet-blue berries. A fine specimen 20 feet in
height is at Menabilly.

RUBUS AUSTRALIS.--A Bramble, the only form of which is worth growing,
and that merely as a curiosity, is a practically leafless one. The
leaves are indeed there, but they consist merely of three midribs armed
with curved spines, and terminated by leaflets less than an inch in
length of an inch in breadth. A large plant at Bishop's Teignton has
smothered a Euonymus bush, and climbed into an adjacent Fir.

SENECIO.--Many of the newer evergreen exotic species, such as _S.
Grayii_, _S. Fosterii_, _S. Heretieri_, and others are grown, while in
Rosehill garden is a fifty-year-old plant of the Mexican _S. Petasitis_,
8 feet in height.

SOLANUM CRISPUM.--Chili. An evergreen flowering shrub, bearing lavender
yellow-centred flowers in profusion, often reaching a height of 8 feet.
Quite common.

SPARMANNIA AFRICANA.--Cape of Good Hope. African Hemp. An evergreen
shrub, bearing masses of white flowers with ruby-tipped anthers; a
well-known greenhouse plant. At Tresco both the single and double
forms are grown, and attain a height of 10 feet. The single form is also
met with in mainland gardens, where it is often in flower in February.

VERONICA HULKEANA.--New Zealand. An evergreen shrub, bearing branching
panicles of pale-lilac flowers, doing best with the support and
protection of a wall. To be found in many gardens.

WESTRINGIA TRIPHYLLA.--Australia. Evergreen shrub, bearing blue flowers
in summer. Tregothnan.

following chapter will succeed in Ireland.




CHAPTER XXV

TENDER WALL PLANTS IN THE SOUTH-WEST


The notes on tender shrubs and trees grown in the south-west are
fittingly supplemented by a passing reference to plants used for
covering walls, mostly of climbing habit, but a few of shrubby growth.

BIGNONIA.--_B. (Tecoma) radicans_ is a hardy climber, and _B.
capreolata_ may also be considered so. Other members of the family grown
in the open are _B. capensis_, Cape of Good Hope, orange; _B. Cherere_,
Guiana, orange scarlet; and _B. speciosa_, Uruguay, pink. Greenway on
the Dart.

BERBERIDOPSIS CORALLINA.--Chili. Drooping crimson flowers borne in
racemes in the autumn. This evergreen plant does best in peat or
leaf-mould in a partially shaded position. Common.

BOUGAINVILLEA GLABRA.--Brazil. This climber cannot be considered a
success in the open in the south-west, but in two gardens it has been
grown and flowers, but in neither case has it exhibited a tithe of the
freedom of growth displayed by it under glass.

BUCKLANDIA POPULNEA.--Himalayas. A handsome evergreen foliage plant,
said to grow to a height of 100 feet in its native habitat. Its large
heart-shaped leaves are tinted with bronze and maroon. Tregothnan.

CALLICARPA PURPUREA.--India. An evergreen shrub bearing small
inconspicuous flowers, followed by violet-coloured berries. Trewidden,
Penzance.

CASSIA CORYMBOSA.--Buenos Ayres. A rambling shrub, almost invariably
grown against a wall, though it has been met with planted against a wire
fence, and spreading out on either side. In August it is a mass of
golden-yellow bloom, some of which it often retains until Christmas.
With wall protection it reaches a height of 12 feet or more, and when in
flower is a striking object in the garden. It is fairly common in the
south-west.

CHORIZEMA.--Australia. Well-known evergreen greenhouse plants, bearing
pea-like flowers of orange and red. Masses 7 feet in height and more in
breadth grow against the walls at Trewidden, and begin to flower in
March. _C. cordatum_ and _C. Lowii_ are the species generally grown.

CISSUS DISCOLOR.--Java. A climber, bearing greenish-yellow blossoms.

CLEMATIS INDIVISA LOBATA.--New Zealand. This beautiful white-flowered
Clematis grows well in many gardens, and commences to bloom in March.

CLIANTHUS PUNICEUS.--New Zealand. A brilliant-flowered evergreen
climber, bearing large flowers, somewhat resembling lobsters' claws,
scarlet crimson in hue. It sometimes comes into flower as early as
Christmas, the number of its blossoms increasing until mid-May, when it
is a glowing sheet of colour. The finest plant Mr. Fitzherbert knows is
at Stoke Fleming, near Dartmouth, where it covers the side of a large
house.

DIPLACUS (MIMULUS) GLUTINOSUS.--California. Another popular greenhouse
plant, bearing buff flowers, which succeeds admirably against walls in
many gardens, growing some 5 feet in height.

ELÆOCARPUS CYANEUS.--Australia. An evergreen plant of shrubby growth,
bearing whitish-blue flowers. Greenway.

ERCILLA (BRIDGESIA) VOLUBILIS.--Chili. A self-clinging evergreen
climber, bearing inconspicuous flowers. Fairly common, but scarcely
attractive.

HIBBERTIA DENTATA.--Australia. An evergreen climber, with foliage of
deep bronze, bearing single bright-yellow flowers in April. Trewidden.
_H. Reidii_, also yellow-flowered. Tregothnan.

HYDRANGEA PETIOLARIS.--Japan. A rampant-growing climber, bearing flat
flower-heads, composed of blooms the minority of which are sterile. It
clings naturally, and is displayed to best advantage when allowed to
ascend a bare tree trunk. At Menabilly, Cornwall, a specimen planted
twelve years ago has ascended the columnar trunk of a Turkey Oak to a
height of almost 40 feet.

INGA PULCHERRIMA.--Mexico. An evergreen shrub, bearing bright-scarlet
flowers in summer. A fine plant covering a large expanse of wall is at
Greenway.

KENNEDYA NIGRICANS.--Australia. An evergreen climber, bearing
violet-purple racemes of small pea-like blossoms. Greenway. _K. alba_
is also grown.

LAPAGERIA.--Chili. This handsome evergreen climber, producing long
wax-like blossoms of white and rose, is well known under glass. In the
south-west it does well in the open against a north wall, in peaty
compost, often bearing its flowers as late as Christmas.

LASIANDRA (PLEROMA TIBOUCHINA) MACRANTHA.--Brazil. A beautiful
evergreen shrub of climbing habit, bearing large violet flowers. It is
usually cut down by frost, but breaks again strongly in the spring.
Trewidden and other gardens.

MANDEVILLA SUAVEOLENS.--Buenos Ayres. A lovely deciduous climber,
bearing large, white, deliciously-fragrant flowers in August. It does
well in several gardens in the south-west, in some of which it seeds
freely.

MICHELIA (MAGNOLIA) FUSCATA.--China. An evergreen or sub-evergreen shrub
(according to position), bearing dull-purple sweetly-scented flowers.
Tregothnan.

PHOENOCOMA PROLIFERA.--Cape of Good Hope.--An evergreen shrub, bearing
large, terminal, crimson flower-heads. Trewidden.

PHYSIANTHUS ALBENS SYN. ARAUJIA ALBENS.--Brazil. An evergreen climber,
bearing a profusion of white flowers, which later assume a reddish
tinge. Common in the south-west. The finest specimen Mr. Fitzherbert has
seen grew against a cliff-face in the public gardens at Torquay. It
spread to a height and breadth of considerably over 20 feet, and one
year bore over a dozen huge corrugated seed-pods, about the size of a
cricket ball, but oval in shape. This strain killed the plant, but a
young one has now taken its place.

PLUMBAGO CAPENSIS.--Cape of Good Hope. A climbing evergreen shrub,
bearing large heads of pale-blue flowers; a favourite conservatory
plant. It is grown in several gardens, and flowers well in the open. A
fine example, which has been unprotected for five months, is growing in
the same site as the Physianthus alluded to above.

PUERARIA THUNBERGIANA.--Khasia. An evergreen climber, with leaves 5
inches in diameter, bearing blue flowers. Fibre is obtained from the
stems and starch from the roots. Tregothnan.

[Illustration: _PUERARIA THUNBERGIANA._]

RHODOCHITON VOLUBILE.--Mexico. A climber, bearing blood-red drooping
flowers. This plant, in common with Lothospermum and Maurandya, all
three of which are perennials, is almost invariably killed by the
winter, but is easily raised from seed. Rosehill, Falmouth.

RHYNCHOSPERMUM (TRACHELOSPERMUM) JASMINOIDES.--Shanghai. An evergreen
climber, hardy in the south-west, bearing countless starry-white
flowers, most delicately perfumed in August. It is to be met with in the
majority of gardens, and in one it has covered the house porch.

RUSCUS ANDROGYNUS SYN. SEMELE ANDROGYNA.--Canary Islands. An evergreen
climber, valuable for its striking foliage. The leaves, or rather
cladodes, are over a foot in length, and are furnished with from
twelve to twenty pinnate sections of a glossy green. Penjerrick,
Falmouth, where it has borne its inconspicuous greenish-white flowers.

SOLANUM WENDLANDI.--Costa Rica. An evergreen climber, bearing clusters
of large lilac-blue flowers, 2½ inches in diameter. The late Rev. H.
Ewbank, in whose garden at Ryde the finest specimen we have seen was
growing, considered it the best of all the tender climbers amenable to
open-air culture in the south-west.

SOLLYA HETEROPHYLLA.--Australia. Bluebell Creeper. An evergreen climber,
bearing drooping blue flowers. Tregothnan.

STAUNTONIA (HOLBOELLIA) LATIFOLIA.--Himalayas. An evergreen climber,
with oval leathery leaves, bearing in April clusters of greenish-white
flowers, delightfully odorous. A very common plant in the south-west.

STREPTOSOLEN JAMESONI.--Columbia. A handsome evergreen shrub, in great
request for clothing conservatory pillars, &c. It bears panicles of
orange-red flowers, and when in full bloom has a brilliant effect. A
plant about 7 feet in height is growing against the house at Trewidden.

SWAINSONIA ALBIFLORA.--Australia. An evergreen leguminous shrub, bearing
white pea-like flowers, well known in greenhouses. It is grown in
several gardens, and if cut down by sharp frosts breaks strongly again
in the spring.

TACSONIA EXONENSIS.--A hybrid between _T. Van Volxemii_ and _T.
mollissima_. Bearing bright rosy-pink flowers. Trewidden.

T. MOLLISSIMA.--Quito. A vigorous species, bearing pink flowers, with
tubes from 4 to 5 inches in length. Though Quito is on the equator, its
height above sea-level being 9600 feet, the temperature is not unduly
high. There is a large plant, which has had to be kept within bounds by
periodical pruning, at Rosehill.




CHAPTER XXVI

TREES AND SHRUBS IN IRELAND


It is not possible, without going beyond the limits of a volume of
comfortable size, to do anything approaching justice to the trees and
shrubs that are the glory of many gardens in the sister Isle. It is a
favoured isle for the growth of Conifers, and trees and shrubs that in
other parts of Britain, except under exceptional conditions, completely
fail. The Sikkim Rhododendrons at Kilmacurragh, Co. Wicklow, the
residence of Mr. Thomas Acton, D.L.; the Rhododendrons and Ghent Azaleas
at Houth Castle, Co. Dublin; the noble Conifers in the gardens of
Viscount Powerscourt at Enniskerry, Wicklow, and of Lord Annesley,
Castlewellan, Co. Down, besides other counties, are well known to every
one deeply interested in trees and shrubs; while among other notable
gardens filled with rare treasures and specimens of individual
development may be named, St. Annes', Clontarf, Co. Dublin; Cong, Co.
Mayo; and Muckross, Killarney, residences of Lord Ardilaun. The gardens
of Mr. W. E. Gumbleton, Belgrove, Queenstown, Cork, contain interesting
collections; and the same may be said of Straffan, Co. Kildare, the Duke
of Leinster's famous residence; Carton, near Maynooth, in the same
county; Woodstock, Kilkenny, the residence of Mrs. Tighe; Hamwood,
Dunboyne, Co. Meath (Mr. R. Hamilton, D.L.); Killarney House, Killarney
(the Lord Kenmare); Kylemore, Co. Mayo (Mr. Mitchell Henry); and Narrow
Water Park, Co. Down (Capt. Roger Hall). And we are not forgetful of the
beautiful Fota Island near Cork (Lord Barrymore), where plants accounted
tender in more northerly latitudes flourish with almost tropical
luxuriance.

The gardens of Ireland must be seen to realise their beauty and climatic
advantages. Ireland is happy in having many enthusiastic gardeners, and
it will be well for those who wish for some information as to the great
variety of trees and shrubs that will live unprotected in the sister
Isle to read the contribution of the Earl of Annesley to the Journal of
the Royal Horticultural Society, upon "Ornamental Trees and Shrubs in
the Gardens at Castlewellan, Co. Down," vol. xxviii. The Earl's garden,
to quote his own words, "Is on one of the foot hills of the Mourne
Mountains in the county of Down, about three miles from the Irish
Channel, thus benefiting by the mild influence of the Gulf Stream: it
faces east and south, and is surrounded by old forest trees, so that it
is well sheltered. We suffer little from frost; ten degrees is the
average; once, in the hard winter of 1895, we had fifteen degrees. The
rainfall is about thirty-two inches; the subsoil is gravel, and as it
lies on rather a steep hill there is perfect drainage--a great advantage
for tender, as indeed it is for all plants."

In a future edition of this work, if it be called for, the gardens of
Ireland in relation to the trees and shrubs that are grown therein will
receive greater justice than it is possible to give at present, owing to
the number of rare and tender species and varieties that are at home in
the sister Isle. Ireland has two interesting Botanic gardens, one
attached to Trinity College, Dublin, of which Mr. F. W. Burbidge, M.A.,
is the well-known curator, and the other at Glasnevin. This is under the
care of Mr. F. W. Moore and is exceptionally beautiful. Both contain
rare trees and shrubs, but the terrific storm in the early part of 1903
wrought sad havoc.




CHAPTER XXVII

HARDY BAMBOOS


Thanks to Lord Redesdale (author of "The Bamboo Garden"), and a few
other gardening enthusiasts, the Bamboo has been made a beautiful
feature of many English gardens. Although a graceful shrubby grass of
quite tropical aspect, the majority of species and their varieties are
thoroughly hardy, so much so that they have passed safely through the
severest winters of the past twenty years. Bamboos and hybrid Water
Lilies are responsible for much of the interest taken in good English
gardening at the present time. Their introduction has marked a distinct
era, and their popularity is wide-spread, while in the near future we
shall regard the Bamboo much as we do the most common of shrubs now
planted. _Arundinaria japonica_ (_B. Metake_) is, of course, an old
favourite, and it is surprising that this stately species did not before
remind English gardeners of the great possibilities of the Bamboos in
the adornment of the pleasure-ground. As Mr. Bean says: "Fifteen or
twenty years ago many of the best of the sorts now largely grown were
unknown in this country; but apart from their novelty they have other
qualities. No evergreens capable of withstanding our winters exceed
these shrubby grasses in beauty and grace, in luxuriance of leafage, or
in their bright, fresh, green tints in winter. Very few, indeed, equal
them."

[Illustration: _GROUPING OF YUCCAS, PAMPAS GRASS, AND BAMBOOS, KEW
(Winter)._]

Although fifty species and varieties of this lovely family are now
grown, only about twenty need be thought of, because many of them from
the ornamental point of view are valueless in the English garden. The
hardy Bamboos belong to three groups or genera--_Phyllostachys_,
_Arundinaria_, and _Bambusa_--and it is well to thoroughly understand
these divisions. We hope those trade growers who still group everything
as Bambusa will follow the now accepted classification. The following
have proved the most hardy and beautiful in the Bamboo garden at Kew:
_Phyllostachys Henonis_, _P. fastuosa_, _P. viridi-glaucescens_, _P.
flexuosa_, _P. nigra_, _P. boryana_, _P. sulphurea_, _P. Marliacea_, _P.
ruscifolia_, _P. Castillonis_, _Arundinaria nitida_, _A. japonica_, _A.
auricoma_, _A. Simoni_, _A. Fortunei_, _A. anceps_, _A. Hindsii var.
graminea_, _Bambusa palmata_, _B. tessellata_, and _B. marmorea_.

[Illustration: _BAMBOO GARDEN AT KEW, WINTER_

(_In centre, Bambusa palmata; left, Phyllostachys Quilioi; right,
Bambusa tessellata_).]

In selecting a place for the Bamboo colony, think well of position.
Shelter from north and east is essential. Luxuriant leafy stems are only
possible when the plants are screened from winds in these quarters,
indeed from _all_ winds. Cold north and east winds are more harmful than
severe frost, and this applies to all the tender evergreens. A moist and
rich soil is also important. Without it luxuriant growth is impossible,
and a Bamboo that is not leafy, that does not bend its tall, graceful
stems to the breeze and make willowy shoots yards high, when it is
natural for it so to do, is not beautiful: the garden is more
interesting without it. Many of the species spread rapidly by
underground stems, and for this reason must never be planted without
careful thought. Each plant should tell its own tale, and not suffer
partial extinction through a choke-muddle arrangement that makes a bank
of leafage perhaps, but in which all individual beauty is hopelessly
lost. Some Bamboos, like _Phyllostachys viridi-glaucescens_ and _P.
Henonis_, need ample space for full development. Transplant always in
_late spring_, never in winter and early spring. When bamboos were first
grown in this country on a large scale many deaths occurred through
transplanting in winter.

With the utmost care Bamboos in the fickle British climate get sadly
browned in February and May, the outcome of either a hard winter or keen
east winds in spring. The stems are seldom injured, and Mr. Bean says
"the underground portion of the plants never is." This scorched look is
not beautiful, and is more apparent as the spring meets summer, when the
whole plant world is bursting into new life and tinting the landscape
with green. Therefore, Bamboos can never be planted so lavishly as
Rhododendrons; and we do not desire a Bamboo plague, beautiful though
the plants are in foliage and growth, so perhaps the east wind is
somewhat of a blessing. Bamboos must have favoured spots. When a single
group is desired, then choose some sheltered corner, and the same
consideration is necessary when making a Bamboo garden or grove. A
beautiful and refreshing feature of many English homes is a ravine of
these lovely grasses, and the Bamboo colony at Kew is accounted one of
the most delightful spots in the Royal Gardens.

In the _Garden_ of February 1, 1902, pp. 73, 74, is an interesting
account of the Bamboos at Kew. As this contains much practical
information, it is reproduced: "Kew was one of the first gardens in
which hardy Bamboos were grown, and it is to a great extent due to this
collection, and the collections of Mr. Freeman Mitford, Messrs. Verten,
and a few other pioneers, that the planting of hardy Bamboos has assumed
its present proportions. The creation of the Kew Bamboo garden dates
back to 1892. Previous to that the cultivation of hardy Bamboos had been
practised under great difficulties. The collection contained only a few
species, planted in poor soil in an exposed position, and were always
unsatisfactory. In addition to Bamboos, there were other
monocotyledonous plants in the same plight, hence the happy idea was
conceived of forming the present Bamboo garden. This garden is situated
on the eastern side of the Rhododendron dell, near the north or Sion
Vista end. It was originally a shallow gravel pit, and is peculiarly
adapted to the requirements of Bamboos. The depression in the ground and
the high bank of the Rhododendron dell give considerable shelter, whilst
a wide belt of large forest trees, which surrounds the north, east, and
south sides, insures almost complete protection from cold winds. The
garden is pear-shaped, and can be entered by three paths on the
south-east, west, and north sides. The banks round the sides are
terraced, and held up by large tree roots placed roots outwards, the
roots forming numerous bays and corners, each of which is given over to
one species. Separated from these bays by a gravel path 9 feet wide is a
central bed of about a quarter of an acre. This is filled with large
clumps of various species and fine single specimens, arranged in such a
way as to open a vista right through the bed here and there or into the
centre. These vistas and openings, together with the paths, add greatly
to the general effect, the plants and groups being well separated and
showing to advantage, while the beauty of the stately upright stems of
some and arching plumes of others, lining or bending over and almost
meeting across the openings, is at once seen. Intermixed with the
Bamboos are Yuccas, Miscanthus, Pampas Grass, and other things, all of
which help to give pleasing variety. Between the back of the garden and
the belt of trees a screen is formed of _Rosa multiflora_, Spiræas,
Rhododendrons, and other shrubs, interspersed with clumps of Pampas
Grass, Yuccas, and some of the strongest and hardiest of the Bamboos.

"When first formed, stiff loam to a depth of 3 feet was spread all over
the garden, and into this large quantities of decayed leaves were mixed;
in this soil the plants have thriven well. A water main runs through the
garden, so that copious supplies of water can be given in dry weather
with little trouble.

"Altogether some forty-one species and varieties of Bamboos are
cultivated. These are composed of seventeen _Arundinarias_, nine
_Bambusas_, and fifteen _Phyllostachys_. The majority belong to China
and Japan, one, however, belonging to North America, and one to India.
The Indian species, _Arundinaria (Thamnocalamus) Falconeri_, which does
so well in the south-west counties and in Ireland, is the most difficult
to manage, and is killed to the ground every winter, while _A. falcata_
and _A. nobilis_, which are two of the most common species in the famous
Cornish gardens, refuse to thrive.

"The arrangement of the plants has undergone considerable modification
since the first planting, owing to natural development and the
introduction of more species. This has resulted in the removal of many
duplicates which have been used with large Rhododendrons as an
undergrowth to the wood adjoining the entrances, thus considerably
enhancing the beauty of the place.

"The period of the year at which the garden is at its best extends from
the early weeks of July until the Cold east winds in February and March,
for, although severe frost has little effect on the leaves of many, cold
winds from east or north quickly turn them brown. That Bamboos should
continue in good condition and practically be at their best through the
worst of the winter months is a strong recommendation in their favour,
and by leaving, as is done at Kew, the tall dead stems and leaves of
_Miscanthus_ and the plumes of the Pampas Grass, touches of colour are
given to relieve the greenery, and add greatly to the general effect.

"Of groups and single specimens the following are some of the most
conspicuous:--

"ARUNDINARIA.--_A. Simoni_, a fine irregular mass, 16 feet high and 50
feet across. _A. nitida_, several fine clumps, 11 feet high and 12 feet
across. _A. japonica_, several large clumps, 11 feet high and 20 feet
across. _A. Hindsii var. graminea_, 9 feet high by 12 feet in diameter.

"BAMBUSA.--_B. palmata_, 7 feet high and 15 feet across; this is very
distinct and handsome, and should be in every collection.

"PHYLLOSTACHYS.--_P. aurea_, 12 feet high by 16 feet through. _P.
Henonis_, 15 feet high by 12 feet. _P. Castillonis_, 12 feet high by 10
feet. _P. nigra_, 15 feet high; several fine masses. _P.
viridi-glaucescens_, 15 feet high and 6 feet through at the base, the
top spreading to 20 feet. There is also a fine specimen of this in
another part of the garden.

"Besides these there are many other fine masses.

"Among plants other than Bamboos found in the garden the Yuccas are
possibly next in importance. One group is on a bank on the north side
having a slope to the south. It is thus exposed to full sun and the
plants are happy. In both summer and winter the group forms a delightful
picture. The groundwork is composed of the elegant glaucous-leaved _Y.
angustifolia_, while here and there a plant of _Y. filamentosa_ has
crept in. Height is given to the group by dot plants of _Y. gloriosa_
and _Y. recurvifolia_, while a plant of _Cotoneaster thymifolia_
growing between the roots in front adds a little in the way of variety.
The whole picture is set in an irregular framing of Bamboos and other
plants, some of the most conspicuous of which are _Miscanthus sinensis_
in front, _Arundinaria japonica_, _A. Hindsii var. graminea_,
_Phyllostachys aurea_ and _P. Castillonis_, and Pampas Grass at the back
and sides.

"A collection of hardy species of Smilax is allowed to ramble at will
over the tree roots which form the bays, each species having its own
particular place. The species cultivated are _S. aspera_ and its
varieties, _S. maculata_ and _S. mauritanica_, _S. Bona-nox var.
hastata_, _S. hispida_, _S. rotundifolia_, and _S. tamnoides_.

"In addition to the plants named, others given places in the garden are
Kniphofias, Funkias, _Eremuri_, _Physalis_ (grown for winter effect),
_Ruscus_, _Asparagus_, &c., the whole forming an interesting collection,
and one which must be seen to be fully appreciated.

"The Kew collection is composed of _Arundinaria anceps_, _A.
auricoma_, _A. chrysantha_, _A. Falconeri_, _A. Fortunei_, _A. F.
compacta_, _A. Hindsii_, _A. H. graminea_, _A. humilis_, _A.
japonica_, _A. macrosperma_, _A. m. tecta_, _A. nitida_, _A. pumila_,
_A. Simoni_, _A. S. variegata_, and _A. Veitchii_. _Bambusa agrestis_,
_B. angustifolia_, _B. disticha_, _B. marmorea_, _B. Nagashima_, _B.
palmata_, _B. pygmæa_, _B. quadrangularis_, and _B. tessellata_.
_Phyllostachys aurea_, _P. bambusoides_, _P. boryana_, _P.
Castillonis_, _P. flexuosa_, _P. fulva_, _P. Henonis_, _P. Marliacea_,
_P. mitis_, _P. nigra_, _P. n. punctata_, _P. Quilioi_, _P.
ruscifolia_, _P. sulphurea_, and _P. viridi-glaucescens_."




CHAPTER XXVIII

THE HEATHS


Few groups of small flowering shrubs are so charming in the garden as
the hardy Heaths. Their usually neat growth, profusion of flowers, and
length of time they are in beauty--sometimes three or four months--make
them of great garden value. Not more than twelve species can be grown in
the open air, but, with one or two exceptions, all are beautiful, as the
following complete list suggests: _Erica arborea_, _E. australis_, _E.
carnea_, _E. ciliaris_, _E. cinerea_, _E. lusitanica_ (or _codonodes_),
_E. Mackaii_, _E. mediterranea_, _E. multiflora_, _E. scoparia_, _E.
stricta_, _E. Tetralix_, and _E. vagans_.

When the whole group is grown, one or more species may be had in flower
every month in the year, except, perhaps, November. A hybrid between _E.
mediterranea_ and _E. carnea_ (sold under the name of _mediterranea
hybrida_) has been seen much of late, and is a very welcome little
shrub, flowers appearing in some years even in November. Every year some
expand before Christmas, and during January it is the brightest plant in
the outdoor garden. _E. carnea_ and the white variety follow it; then in
a cluster come _E. australis_, _E. arborea_, _E. lusitanica_
(_codonodes_), _E. mediterranea_ and its several varieties, which fill
up the months from March to May, and from June onwards we have _E.
cinerea_, _E. ciliaris_, _E. Mackaii_, _E. scoparia_ (the least worthy
of the Heaths), _E. stricta_, and _E. Tetralix_. The two allied species,
_E. vagans_ and _E. multiflora_, carry on the Heath season until
October.

The Heaths are happiest in a peaty soil. The great Heath nurseries are
all on soil of that nature, but it is not essential. A loamy medium can,
by adding leaf-mould and, if necessary, sand, be made to suit all the
Heaths, and some, such as _E. cinerea_ and _E. mediterranea_, are quite
at home on a calcareous soil. Choose positions for them well exposed to
the sun, with, if possible, a cool, moist bottom. The ways of planting
vary, of course, according to the character of the species and varieties
selected. The rather free-growing and taller Heaths, like _lusitanica_
and _arborea_, may be planted in informal groups on sloping banks, or
more sparsely with a dwarfer species like _E. carnea_ as the groundwork.
_E. lusitanica_ and _E. arborea_, being somewhat tender, are only seen
at their best in the south and west, but beautiful effects have been got
by planting them in irregular and scattered groups on grassy slopes. The
natural grouping of Gorse and Broom suggests a way of using the many
beautiful Heaths.

_E. mediterranea_ and its varieties, a beautiful group, and much hardier
than the two species just mentioned, have flowers of shades of purple
and white. Delightful effects are possible when they are planted in
bold, informal groups, especially on sloping banks or ground, their
flowers appearing over a period of ten or twelve weeks. Dwarf Heaths,
like _E. carnea_, _c. alba_, _cinerea_, &c., may be used as edgings to
beds of heathy plants. I am indebted to Mr. Bean for the following
excellent notes about the Heaths, and the reason this group has a
chapter to itself is to encourage a greater use of shrubs, strangely
neglected in English gardens. The beauty of Heath in bloom appeals to
poet and painter. Moorlands surfaced with colour, hill upon hill of
softened shades fading away in the distance, are pleasant
memories--pictures beautiful enough, we should have thought, to tempt
the planter of the English garden to reproduce in a small way in the
homelands. I hope this chapter will do something to make the beautiful
wild Heaths and their varieties welcome in rough, peaty grounds and
banks, and the many other places where they would be as happy as on
their native moors and hillsides.


THE TALLER OR TREE-LIKE HEATHS

_Erica arborea._--This is the most remarkable of all the hardy Heaths;
it grows to quite a small tree. In the Isle of Wight, and doubtless
elsewhere, it has been known to grow 30 feet high, with a trunk 39
inches in circumference. It is found wild in considerable abundance
along the Mediterranean coast region between Genoa and Marseilles, the
wood being used in the manufacture of the so-called Briar pipes, Briar
being a corruption of the French word Bruyère. All the Heaths flower
with great freedom but none more so than _E. arborea_ and its near
ally, _E. lusitanica_. The flowers are almost globular and nearly white;
they are quite small individually, but produced so abundantly that the
plants are smothered with them from March to May. My experience of this
species is that it is hardier and thrives altogether better in the
London district than _E. lusitanica_, a species for which it is often
grown. It ripens seed every year almost, and can thus be readily
increased in a natural way. The young wood is densely covered with short
dark hairs and the leaves are closely packed in whorls of three.

_E. lusitanica_ (syn. _codonodes_).--Many will not recognise the name
_lusitanica_ as applied to the well-known _E. codonodes_, but
_lusitanica_ is really an older designation. This Heath, as its name
implies, comes from Portugal; it is also a native of Spain, and is often
confounded with _E. arborea_. Briefly, they differ in the following
respects: The flowers of _E. lusitanica_ are longer and more bell-shaped
than the globular ones of _E. arborea_; the foliage of _E. lusitanica_
is a rather pale green, and has a rather more plumose look, the
individual leaf being longer and more slender; the young wood, although
downy, is not so hairy as in _E. arborea_. The remarkable abundance of
flowers, a feature of _E. arborea_, is quite as apparent in this
species, their colouring is a faintly pink-tinged white. From Messrs. R.
Veitch and Sons, of Exeter, who are taking a special interest in these
tree Heaths Kew has lately received a form intermediate between _E.
arborea_ and _E. lusitanica_--probably it is a hybrid. _E. lusitanica_
does not apparently grow so large as _E. arborea_, but it is recorded to
have reached 12 feet in height in Sussex. Farther west, in Dorsetshire,
it grows luxuriantly, and is certainly one of the loveliest of
evergreens that can be grown even in that favoured county. Seeds afford
the best means of propagation.

_E. australis._--One of the most beautiful and rare of all the Heaths,
but unfortunately it is not so hardy as the majority. In the southern
and western counties, however, it will thrive admirably, withstanding 20
degrees of frost without serious injury, provided the winter is not
unusually protracted. It is curious that in spite of its beauty it is
little known even in Cornwall, Devon, and similar localities, where it
would doubtless thrive to perfection. It has been grown at Kew for the
last six years, and although the winters during that period have not
been very severe, it has stood out all the time, and it flowers
regularly and profusely every spring. It can be increased by cuttings
put in at the end of July or the beginning of August. _E. australis_ is
a native of Spain and Portugal; it flowers in April and May, and lasts
eight weeks in beauty. The flowers are rich, bright, rosy red, brighter,
indeed, than those of any other Heath; they are fragrant,
pitcher-shaped, and about a quarter-inch long. The species has been
confounded with _E. mediterranea_, which often does duty for it, but it
is distinguished by having the flowers produced generally four or eight
together in terminal clusters. (Those of _E. mediterranea_ appear in the
leaf axils.) Those who have gardens in well-sheltered or mild
localities should grow this beautiful Heath. The difficulty at present
is to get hold of the right thing; I am glad to know, however, that some
trade firms are taking it up. It is said to grow 6 to 8 feet high, but I
have not seen plants half as high.

[Illustration: _ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL HEATHS (Erica carnea)._]

_E. mediterranea._--Of all the taller Heaths this is the one, I think,
that deserves to be most freely planted in districts no warmer than the
London one. The three preceding species, so beautiful when seen at their
best, are more comfortable in the southern and western counties. Of
sturdier constitution, _E. mediterranea_ may be planted in large
quantities with a view to producing broad effects. At Kew a group 70
feet across, planted three or four years ago, already makes a striking
mass of purple each spring. The habit of remaining for a long time in
full beauty, which is so marked a characteristic of the Heaths, is
possessed to the full extent by this species. It is beautiful from March
to May, and is all the more appreciated because the majority of the
trees and shrubs that bloom at this season have yellow, pink, or white
flowers. In the typical _E. mediterranea_ the flowers are bright rosy
red, but there is a charming white-flowered variety (_alba_), another
with bluish foliage (_glauca_), and a dwarf one (_nana_). The flowers
appear near the ends of the shoots in the axils of the leaves, and are
pitcher-shaped. The name _mediterranea_ is misleading, for according to
Moggridge, the Mediterranean botanist, it is not a native of that
region at all; it is rather of Biscayan origin, and is found in Western
France and Spain.

On the boggy heaths of Galway and Mayo a form of this species is found;
it is known as _E. mediterranea var. hibernica_, and grows 2 to 5 feet
high. The typical _E. mediterranea_ was represented in the Syon gardens
seventy years ago by a specimen 10 feet high. Do any such noble examples
remain in this country now? _E. mediterranea hybrida_ has been already
alluded to.

_E. stricta._--Although not so strikingly beautiful as the Heaths
previously mentioned, _E. stricta_ is the hardiest of all the taller
species. In inclement districts, where a tall Heath is desired, it may
be recommended; it grows from 5 to 6 feet high, and is of erect and
sturdy growth, with leaves borne in whorls four to six together; they
are deep green, and a large mass of plants with their erect plumose
branches produces a somewhat unusual effect. _E. stricta_, like so many
Heaths, has a long flowering season; it begins to bloom in June, is at
its best in July, but three months later flowers may still be gathered.
The flowers are pale purple, and produced in terminal clusters. It has
been in cultivation since 1765, and is a native of South-Western Europe;
it is occasionally labelled _E. ramulosa_.

[Illustration: _A GROUPING OF HEATHS (Erica mediterranea and vars. alba
and hybrida)._]

_E. scoparia._--This species has proved to be the tallest Heath near
London, for it has during the last few years grown as high as 9 feet.
This gives it a certain distinction, but when regarded as a
flower-bearing plant it is, I think, the least worthy of the tribe.
The flowers are crowded in the leaf axils in great profusion, but are
small and greenish white; the growth of the plant is somewhat straggling
and uneven, but it has one merit--viz., it is quite hardy. I have seen
its stems split by hard frost on more than one occasion during the last
twelve years, but no permanent injury has resulted. It flowers in June,
and is a native of the mountainous country to the north of the
Mediterranean, especially about Mentone.


THE DWARFER HEATHS

The dwarf Heaths can be used quite differently from the more tree-like
species that have just been described: as a carpeting beneath
sparsely-planted shrubs, for furnishing sloping banks, or for growing on
the small terraces of the Rock Garden they are equally useful. And of
all these dwarf Heaths more can be said in favour of _E. carnea_ than of
any other species. It is not only absolutely hardy, but it flowers with
astonishing freedom at a time of year when flowers are particularly
cherished. Its flowering, of course, somewhat depends upon the weather,
but frequently one may see its bright rosy bells almost as soon as
January comes in. By the end of February the entire plant is a mass of
beautiful colour, and for two or three months longer they retain their
freshness no matter what weather may occur. So free-flowering is this
Heath that its flowers literally cover it. _E. carnea_ is one of those
plants (and there are many of them) which, although perfectly well
known and quite common, are still not used in gardens so freely as they
ought to be. The majority of our early-flowering plants bear flowers
that are either white or yellow, so that the rosy-red colouring of this
Erica makes a welcome change. However freely it might be planted it
would never become wearisome or out of place, for its tints, though
bright and warm, are not harsh. Statements have been recently published
to the effect that _E. carnea_ is a British plant. This idea appears to
have originated with Bentham, the botanist, who regarded _E. carnea_ and
_E. mediterranea_ as the same species. Following out this idea, he
included the plant which has already been alluded to as a form of _E.
mediterranea_, which is found in Western Ireland, in his Flora of
Britain as a form of _E. carnea_. Possibly he was right from the
standpoint of the botanist, but the plant grown in gardens and nurseries
as _E. carnea_ is quite distinct from _E. mediterranea_. It is usually
not more than 6 to 8 inches high, and is a native of the mountains of
Central Europe.

[Illustration: _WHITE SCOTCH HEATHER (Erica cinerea alba)._]

_E. cinerea_ (Scotch Heather).--Over almost the whole of these
islands, from the Highlands of Scotland to the moors of Devon and
Cornwall, this Heath occurs more or less abundantly. During the late
summer and early autumn--it flowers from July onwards--it covers miles
of Exmoor with bright-purple colouring, being usually associated with
one of the dwarf autumn-flowering Gorses (_Ulex Gallii_). In gardens
it has produced several forms, the two most brilliantly coloured being
_atrosanguinea_ and _atropurpurea_, but all the forms of this Heath
are beautiful in colour, ranging from white to crimson. _E. carnea_
loves the cool pure mountain air, and on hot and sandy soil in the
Thames Valley is short-lived. At the same time it thrives admirably in
gardens where a moist, cool bottom can be provided and where the air
is pure. Altogether it makes an admirable succession to _E. carnea_.

_E. ciliaris_ (Dorset Heath).--Although in smoky and foggy places, such
as London, this Heath is not always satisfactory, in the purer air of
the surrounding counties it is a delightful shrub. In some of the old
oak-bearing country, in Sussex, for instance, it succeeds to perfection.
It is a native of Britain, but is, I believe, confined to Cornwall and
Dorset in England, and to Galway in Ireland. It has long, slender,
prostrate stems, from which spring erect flower-bearing branches; the
rich rose-purple flowers are borne in a long raceme, and they are the
largest individually of those of all the native Heaths. The leaves are
nearly always in threes, and, like all the younger parts of the plant,
are covered with hairs and pubescence; it flowers from July onwards.

[Illustration: _WHITE MEDITERRANEAN HEATH (Erica mediterranea alba)._]

_E. maweana._--This appears to be a fine variety of _E. ciliaris_, with
larger leaves and flowers, even richer in colour and of sturdier growth.
It was discovered in Portugal some thirty years or so ago by Mr. George
Maw, but has not become popular notwithstanding its beauty. It was
obtained for the Kew collection from Messrs. Cunningham and Fraser, of
Edinburgh, three or four years ago, and certainly promises to be a
better grower there than _E. ciliaris_. The flowers are rich crimson and
in large racemes.

_E. Watsoni._--This is a supposed natural hybrid between _E. ciliaris_
and _E. Tetralix_, and was first discovered near Truro by Mr. H. C.
Watson. It has rosy-crimson flowers produced in a flatter raceme than
that of _E. ciliaris_. In this character and in other ways it is
intermediate between the parents.

_E. Tetralix_ (the Cross-leaved Heath or Bell Heather).--This beautiful
Heath grows on most of the moors and mountain-sides throughout the
British Isles, being perhaps the most widely spread of all the true
Ericas in this country. It is called the "Cross-leaved Heath" because of
the arrangement of the leaves, which are in whorls of four. It is not
very distinct in general appearance from _E. ciliaris_, being downy and
hairy on its young slender leaves, &c. It differs, however, in the
arrangement of the flowers, which are in a terminal umbel. The leaves of
_E. ciliaris_ are usually in threes at each node, and, of course, its
distribution in Britain is much more restricted than that of _E.
Tetralix_. There are other minor points of difference that need not be
referred to here. The "Cross-leaved Heath" grows 1 to 1½ feet high, and
has bright rose-coloured flowers. There is a white-flowered variety
(_alba_), and a very pubescent one named _mollis_.

_E. Mackaii._--This is so closely allied to _E. Tetralix_ that it is
regarded merely as a variety by some authorities. It was first found in
Galway in Ireland, between Roundstone Bay and Clifden. It has since
proved to be a native also of Spain. It is a charming garden plant
flowering from July to September. The leaves have the same right-angled
arrangement as those of _E. Tetralix_, but the flower is shorter,
broader, and of a paler rose.

_E. vagans_ (Cornish Heath).--This Heath is one of the most useful of
dwarf evergreens, growing vigorously, especially when planted in good
soil. I think, however, it flowers better and has more of the typical
Heath character when in somewhat poor, sandy soil. In England it is
almost or quite confined to Cornwall, but occurs also in Ireland and
South-West Europe. It is especially valuable in the garden because it
flowers late, beginning in July and keeping on until October. Its
flowers are crowded in racemes 4 to 6 inches long, and they are pinkish
purple in colour. The plants may be kept neater and more compact by
removing the flowering portion of the shoots before growth recommences
in the following spring. Left to themselves, especially in soil that is
at all rich, the plants are apt to get straggling and unkempt.

_E. multiflora._--This belongs to the same type of Heath as _E. vagans_,
the Cornish Heath, but differs in its more compact growth and shorter
racemes of flowers. Although not so vigorous and showy, it may still be
preferred for some situations. It is a neater plant, and its lower
branches have not the same tendency to get sprawling and ungainly as _E.
vagans_. In other respects it is much like that species, the leaves
being of similar shape and arrangement, and the flowers of a paler
purple; the raceme, however, is only 2 inches or so long. _E.
multiflora_ is not found in Britain, but is a native of the country to
the north of the Mediterranean Sea from France to Greece.

_Calluna vulgaris._--This has been named Erica (Heath), and may be
appropriately included in this chapter on Heaths. It is the Common Heath
of mountain and moor, is very closely allied to the true Heaths, and has
given rise to many varieties. It likes a peaty or sandy soil, and is
longer-lived and more profuse flowering under cultivation in poor rather
than rich soil. It is very charming when grown in natural masses in the
wilder parts of the garden, and its value is all the greater because it
flowers when almost all other shrubs are out of bloom, viz., from July
to October. Numerous varieties are offered by the trade, amongst which
the following are the most noteworthy, either for their beauty or for
their distinctness: _Alba_ (white), _Alporti_ (crimson), _aurea_ (golden
leaved), _tenuis_ (red), _pygmæa_, and _hypnoides_ (both dwarf).

_Daboecia polifolia_ (St. Dabeoc's Heath) is a lovely little shrub, a
close relative of the Heaths, and found wild in the west of Ireland. It
grows a little over 1 foot high, and bears bell-shaped flowers rather
abundantly on erect terminal spikes. They are purple or white, and
sometimes have both colours in one flower, and the plants continue to
produce them from July or August till the frosts come. It is quite as
plentiful as the dwarf Heaths. _Alba_ is a white variety. _Menziesia
polifolia_ is its former name, and is still found under that title in
books.

The three most suitable Heaths for limestone are _Erica carnea_,
_vagans_, and _mediterranea_.




CHAPTER XXIX

NATIVE AND OTHER HARDY EVERGREENS


Rambling about the country in winter, one becomes more and more
impressed with the beauty of our native evergreen trees and shrubs.
Seven names comprise them all--Yew, Holly, Scotch Fir, Spruce, Juniper,
Box, and Ivy. Even of these the Scotch and Spruce Firs (commonly
so-called, though the Scotch is a Pine) are doubtful natives, though so
long acclimatised that they may be classed with our own. Those who are
laying out new grounds on a large scale would do well to plant these
grand things in plenty; indeed, in the case of any new planting that is
taken in hand, unless the owner has a good knowledge of shrubs and some
taste in their choice and disposition, a planting of these alone would
save him from many a regrettable mistake, and from the prospect of the
usual senseless jumble of mixed shrubbery that has hopelessly spoilt
thousands of gardens.

No foreign shrubs can compare with or take the place of our Yews and
Hollies. However large a collection of exotics may be in a well-stocked
arboretum, a winter walk among them only shows that there is nothing
more cheerfully handsome than our Hollies, or more solemnly dignified
than our Yews. On dry, sandy soils no Conifer is better for England
than the Scotch Fir; or for moist, loamy regions and valley bottoms none
is better than the Spruce. Exception is sometimes taken to the Spruce;
and when planted in other than the place it likes it is, indeed, a
wretched object, as on dry and hilly grounds. But a mass of Common
Spruce in a cool, alluvial bottom is a picture of well-being, and no one
can deny their majesty on alpine hillsides. The Douglas Fir is sometimes
recommended in its stead, but this beautiful and quick-growing tree must
still be regarded as an experiment. There is not as yet a single old
Douglas Fir, and there are some among our botanical experts who are yet
in doubt whether, for all its young vigour, it will be a lasting tree
for our country. For dry uplands in light soil there is the lovely
Juniper, best of all its kind (though often in nurseries foreign ones
only are offered to its exclusion), and for chalky soils and loams the
Box luxuriates, and can be used as a small tree, as well as in its usual
bush form.

The use of Common Ivy should not be forgotten. Tree or bush ivies are
amongst the most beautiful and effective of winter plants, all flowering
from October to January. A noble evergreen is the tree form of _Ivy
amurensis_.

In Ireland we have the Arbutus _Unedo_, and _A. Andrachne_ is a tree
once seen will always be remembered; its coloured bark is very
beautiful.

IMPORTANCE OF A SUITABLE CLIMATE.--Evergreen shrubs luxuriate generally
in the climate of the British Isles, especially in the southern and
western counties, and constitute one of the great glories of the English
garden, delighting in these sea-bound islands, with their cool and moist
atmosphere.

It has been established, therefore, that the evergreen seeks an equable
climate, free from extremes of cold and heat, and with an even supply of
moisture to both leaf and root, favouring in a marked degree the
sea-coast with its salt-laden winds. As we travel south, so
opportunities for growing an increasing variety of evergreen trees and
shrubs become more apparent, until, in the south of Cornwall and the
south-west of Ireland, things may be planted out with safety which
towards the midlands and north would scarcely exist. But latitude is not
everything, and easily proved so by the rude vigour of plants from New
Zealand and the Himalayas that are happy in the north of Scotland, but
failures in the midlands and further south of England, requiring the
protection of glass to develop their characteristic beauty.

The place for the tender evergreens must be protected from dry north and
east winds. Mr. Bean writes me: "One of the most striking examples I
have met with of the importance of having a situation such as is
described is the Duchess' garden at Belvoir Castle. Belvoir is in the
eastern midlands, a district where the average temperature is certainly
not high, and where, during my stay there, the thermometer fell on more
than one occasion to zero (Fahr.). Yet in this particular spot (known
as the Duchess' garden) there were fine specimens of Himalayan
Rhododendrons--one of _R. Falconeri_ being especially noteworthy for the
way it grew and flowered--an _Azara microphylla_, 16 feet high, and
other similar examples. The explanation of these successes, I believe,
is entirely in the situation and exposure of the garden. It was formed
on the slope of a rather steep hill, and is in the shape of an
amphitheatre opening freely to the south. The bitter 'north-easter'
loses much of its sting before it reaches the plants in this garden. In
most gardens it is, of course, impossible to obtain sites so favourable
as this. One has to make the best of what exists. But at the same time
it shows the desirability, often the necessity, of choosing positions
for the tenderer evergreens in which this need of shelter is
satisfactorily met. Bamboos, Camellias, many Rhododendrons, Elæagnus,
all afford striking examples of the value of a shelter belt on the north
and east sides." A cool, moist soil is generally necessary for evergreen
shrubs, and we know this to be true from the distress shown by many
kinds during a dry and parching summer.

THE TIME TO TRANSPLANT.--Early autumn, but much depends upon the
previous weather. It often happens that evergreens cannot be lifted
through a dry soil. The same trees after winter rains may be moved with
ease and safety in April or May. An evergreen should be disturbed whilst
the roots are active, and by doing this in September the shrub can
establish itself before winter--hence the object of waiting until late
spring, when autumn has been missed, as root growth has again begun.
Autumn is a season generally of much atmospheric moisture, grateful
dews, and welcome rains. It is the season for planting in general, and
seldom is the work seriously disturbed until Christmas is past. We have
shifted many evergreens without one failure in April and quite late in
May, but our anxieties are great when the life-giving rains refuse to
refresh the earth. The spring of 1901 will never be forgotten as a
season of dry winds and brilliant sunshine, without rain to temper the
unfortunate conditions, and the result was a great loss amongst newly
planted evergreens. Mr. Bean says: "Some evergreens can with reasonable
care be moved with perfect safety at any time, except perhaps from July
to September. Rhododendrons are an example. During the last ten years I
have transplanted them in every month of the year, except July and
August. Indeed, in the case of Rhododendrons and most evergreen
ericaceous plants, the problems of transplanting scarcely arise, simply
because the fine fibres hold the soil so completely that the root system
can, with due care, be removed practically intact. For the same reasons,
very careful transplanting, such as is practised with a transplanting
machine, may also be done at almost any season.

"When the roots of large evergreen shrubs have been unavoidably damaged,
it is often a good plan to remove a portion of the leafy branches. This
helps to restore, in some measure, the balance between root and top. The
shrub will frequently do this itself. Hollies, for instance, often lose
a large proportion of their leaves after transplanting in spring; it is
one of the surest signs of success, just as the _shrivelling_ of the
leaves on the branches is the worst. Evergreen oaks also furnish other
examples." A difference of opinion exists as to removing any of the
leafy branches. A great authority writes me: "Keep on all the foliage
you can. I have seen this succeed with large deciduous trees."

Remember that Evergreen oaks planted in late spring or in summer should
receive a thorough soaking of water once, then no more until new growth
begins. _Syringe freely three times a day in hot weather._ I once saw a
yew hedge that had been planted in mid-winter, the wrong time; it was
looking rather brown through exposure to March winds. The time I refer
to (April) a man was pouring water into the roots and the result was
that nearly all these fine plants died. Had he damped the foliage twice
or thrice a day instead they would have all lived. It is important in
the case of newly planted yew and holly hedges to protect by screens of
spruce boughs secured to a hurdle or any other material suitable at hand
to assist the plants until they have started into growth.

PRUNING.--This is a great advantage to all Evergreens in moderation; the
majority, if left to their own will, become straggling in growth and
unsightly.

Evergreens differ from deciduous plants in regard to time of pruning.
Most deciduous things may be pruned at any time between the fall of the
leaf and the recommencement of growth in spring. But evergreens should
never be pruned in late autumn or winter. For plants that are grown
merely for foliage sake and not for the flowers, pruning should be done
just as new growth is commencing. In the case of flowering shrubs like
Rhododendron or Berberis it should be done as soon as the flowering
season is past.

Rhododendrons are improved by pruning, but the pruner must know
something of the varieties and their growth. _Berberis stenophylla_
gains in beauty by severe pruning, thinning out and cutting back after
flowering is over. It helps the plant to make those long, drooping
growths which are so beautiful in spring.

CLIMBING EVERGREENS.--One of the peculiarities of the evergreen class of
plants is the marked absence of climbing species in cool temperate
countries--that is, true climbers, not, the numerous things that are
made to do duty as such on walls. If one takes up a tree and shrub
catalogue of even the best nurserymen, one is struck by the few
evergreen climbers offered. In spite of the fact that the cool,
temperate regions of the earth have been so thoroughly ransacked during
the last century, no plant has ever been found that equals or even
approaches in value the Common Ivy and its varieties for the special
purposes for which they are adapted. The best that are available are the
Jasmine, _Ercilla volubilis_ (_Bridgesia spicata_), Smilax, _Clematis
calycina_, and tenderer things like Lardizabala and _Passiflora
cærulea_.

[Illustration: _WEEPING HOLLY ON LAWN._]

Evergreens as a whole are much neglected in ordinary gardens. Instead of
drawing upon the great wealth of shrubs available, so many go on using
the same old things over and over again, generally Aucuba, Portugal and
Cherry Laurels, _Rhododendron ponticum_, and such like.

THE HOLLY is one of the most beautiful of all evergreen shrubs, and many
varieties are not known, _Ilex Wilsoni_, for example, and _Laurifolia
nova_ (_Camelliæfolia_) which is very distinct from the former. The best
of the Hollies, _Hodginsii_ (syn. _Shepherdii_), _Marnockii_,
_Hendersonii_, _platyphylla_, _fructu-luteo_ (yellow-berried),
_Handsworthensis_, _Laurifolia_, _Maderensis atrovirens_, which are all
green-leaved varieties. Of variegated varieties, very beautiful are
Golden Queen and Silver Queen, Handsworth Silver, _Argentea marginata_,
and Mme. Briot. _Watereriana_ (Waterer's dwarf golden) makes an
excellent little bush, with smooth leaves blotched and edged with
yellow.

THE BEST EVERGREENS.--The following is a representative list of the
hardier species of evergreens which are considered most deserving of
attention, and I have roughly grouped them according to their size.
Conifers are not included. There is, of course, considerable difference
in the sizes to which evergreens attain, according to the climate in
which they are growing. The grouping here is merely intended to give an
approximate idea of their habit. Those marked with an asterisk (*) are
the more tender ones, and although valuable in the southern and warmer
parts of the country, have not been grown in the colder localities, or
if so, against a wall.

(i.) TREES

Common Box and varieties, especially Handsworthensis, which is
  exceptionally hardy. The variety pendula is very handsome in the
  shrubbery and Japonica aurea is one of the finest shrubs ever
  introduced for giving colour to the garden in winter. This plant
  should be pruned in spring to get the full rich colouring.

Common Holly and varieties, especially such superb varieties as, of the
  large-leaved varieties, Wilsoni, Mundyi, Shepherdi, Camelliæfolia

It must not be forgotten that our British evergreens flourish in the
coldest parts of Yorkshire in a climate that may be considered the most
trying for vegetation in the British Isles. Hollies and Rhododendrons,
where planting has been done on the hillsides, may be seen as quite
large trees. The New Zealand Olearia Haasti may also be seen there--7
feet to 8 feet high and as much through.




CHAPTER XXX

SHRUBS FOR SMALL GARDENS


It is possible in small gardens to grow many beautiful shrubs without
constant cutting of the branches to keep them within set bounds. Those
mentioned in the following list will grow in ordinary soil. Transplant
during late autumn and early winter; and one golden rule to observe in
the case of shrubs obtained from nurseries is to plant them in their
permanent position as soon as possible after they are received, but
should anything occur to prevent this, the roots must be well covered
with soil till planting takes place. In winter large numbers of plants
are sold at auction rooms, but though they may appear cheap, this is not
always so, as there is no guide to the length of time they have been out
of the ground, and in a dry atmosphere many of the smaller roots may
have perished. Such plants take a long time to recover from the check.
If trees or shrubs are bought at a local nursery, there is the great
advantage of getting them in the ground again as soon as possible. The
shrubs named are fully described elsewhere in this book.


_Aucubas_, 3 to 6 feet. Evergreen shrubs, some with variegated, others
with plain green leaves. The male and female forms are separate. If the
latter are fertilised, bright-red berries result.

_Azaleas_, 3 to 6 feet. For moist and peaty soil.

_Berberis Aquifolium_, 4 feet; _B. Darwinii_, 6 to 8 feet; _B.
stenophylla_, 6 to 8 feet; _B. Thunbergi_, 2 to 3 feet; _B. vulgaris
purpurea_, 5 to 6 feet (a purple-leaved variety of the Common Barberry).

_Cornus Spaethii_, 4 feet. This has rich golden foliage.

_Cotoneaster frigida_, 12 to 15 feet. A sturdy tree, with scarlet
berries in autumn. _C. horizontalis_, 2 feet; _C. microphylla_, 3 feet;
_C. Simonsii_, 5 to 8 feet.

_Cratægus Oxyacantha_ (Common Hawthorn). As a small tree this is
delightful in small gardens, especially the double-flowered forms, of
which the richest in colour is Paul's double crimson. As a contrast to
this there is the double white.

_Cytisus albus_ (White Broom), 6 feet; _C. nigricans_, 4 feet; _C.
præcox_ (Sulphur Broom), _C. scoparius_ (Common Broom), 6 feet; _C. s.
andreanus_.

_Daphne Cneorum_ (Garland Flower), 1 foot; _D. Mezereum_ (the Mezereon),
and the white variety _alba_.

_Deutzia crenata fl. pl._, 6 to 8 feet; _D. gracilis_, _D. hybrida_.

_Elæagnus pungens_, 6 feet. This is not so much planted as it should be;
it is a rounded evergreen bush of great charm; flowers fragrant,
November and December. There is a good variegated variety.

_Euonymus japonicus_, 4 to 8 feet; _E. radicans_, 1½ feet. The
variegated variety is very popular.

_Forsythia suspensa_, 6 to 8 feet. A climbing shrub, but may be kept in
bush form if pruned back hard after flowering. A mass of
golden-yellow flowers in March or April.

_Genista hispanica_ (Spanish Furze), 2 feet; _G. sagittalis_.

_Hamamelis arborea_ (Japanese Witch Hazel), 6 to 10 feet; _H.
zuccariniana_.

_Hedera_ (Ivy). It must not be forgotten that several varieties form
bushes. These are known as Tree Ivies, and are invaluable in shady
spots.

[Illustration: _HIBISCUS SYRIACUS (Althæa frutex), VAR. CÆRULEUS._]

_Hibiscus syriacus_, 6 to 7 feet.

_Hydrangea Hortensia_ (Common Hydrangea), 4 to 8 feet; _H. paniculata
grandiflora_, 4 to 8 feet. Pruned back hard before starting into growth
in spring, this can be kept dwarf, and if liquid manure is given the
heads of creamy-white flowers in early autumn are very fine.

_Hypericum calycinum_ (Rose of Sharon), 1 foot. Grows well under trees.
_H. moserianum_, 2 feet.

_Ilex Aquifolium_ (Common Holly). A familiar and handsome evergreen
tree. The best variegated varieties are Golden Queen, Handsworth Silver,
and Silver Queen. _I. crenata_ (Japanese Holly).

_Jasminum nudiflorum_ (Winter-flowered Jasmine), Common White Jasmine.
Both for walls or to ramble over some support.

_Kerria japonica_, 5 feet. This little-known shrub should be more grown;
its yellow flowers are small but pretty. _Flore-pleno_ is a popular
variety.

_Laburnum._

_Ligustrum ovalifolium aureum_ (Golden-leaved Privet), _L. sinense_
(Chinese Privet).

_Magnolia conspicua_ (Yulan), 10 to 30 feet; _M. Lennei_, 6 to 12 feet;
_M. soulangeana_, 6 to 15 feet; _M. stellata_, 3 to 6 feet.

_Osmanthus ilicifolius atropurpeus._

_Philadelphus coronarius_ (Mock Orange), 8 to 12 feet; _P.
grandiflorus_, 10 to 15 feet; _P. hybrids_.

[Illustration: _MOCK ORANGE (Philadelphus coronarius)._]

_Prunus._ This genus includes the Almonds, Apricots, Cherries, Peaches,
Plums, and Laurels. The best are the Almond, Double-flowered Gean (_P.
Avium fl. pl._), _P. davidiana_, _P. japonica_ (_P. sinensis_), _P.
Laurocerasus_ (Common Laurel), _P. lusitanica_ (Portugal Laurel), _P.
persica_ (the Peach), _P. pseudo-cerasus_, _P. triloba_, 6 to 12 feet.

_Pyrus Aucuparia_ (Mountain Ash or Rowan tree). _P. floribunda_, _P.
japonica_ (_Cydonia japonica_), _P. Maulei_, _P. spectabilis fl. pl._

_Rhododendrons._ Excellent where soil and surroundings are suitable.

_Rhodotypus kerrioides_, 4 to 6 feet.

_Rhus Cotinus_ (Venetian Sumach, Wig Tree, Smoke Bush), 5 to 8 feet; _R.
glabra_, 6 to 12 feet; _R. typhina_, 8 to 15 feet.

_Ribes aureum_ (Golden-flowered Currant), 4 to 6 feet; _R. sanguineum_,
4 to 6 feet.

_Robinia hispida_ (Rose Acacia), 8 to 12 feet. A delightful tree; rosy
flower clusters in early summer, but very brittle. Must not be in
wind-swept corners. _R. Pseudacacia elegans_ (False Acacia), 20 feet;
the Common False Acacia is too large for small gardens.

_Rubus deliciosus_, 5 to 6 feet.

_Skimmia Fortunei_ and _S. japonica_, 2 to 4 feet. Two neat little
evergreen shrubs, with bright-crimson berries in winter. Cool, moist
soil.

_Spartium junceum_ (Spanish Broom).

_Spiræa arguta_, 4 to 5 feet; _S. ariæfolia_, 8 to 10 feet, very
beautiful; _S. Douglasi_, 6 feet; _S. japonica_ (_S. callosa_) and
varieties (see tables); _S. media_, 4 feet; _S. prunifolia fl. pl._, 6
to 8 feet; _S. Thunbergi_, 4 to 5 feet.

_Symphoricarpus racemosus_ (Snowberry), 5 to 6 feet. The variegated
variety of the Common Snowberry is pretty.

_Syringa vulgaris_ (Lilac), 8 to 12 feet.

_Ulex europæus fl. pl._ (Double-flowered Furze or Gorse), 4 to 6 feet.
Beautiful in hot and dry soil.

_Viburnum Opulus sterile_ (Guelder Rose or Snowball tree), _V.
plicatum_, 5 to 6 feet.

_Vinca major_ (Periwinkle), 6 inches to 1 foot. A little creeping shrub,
delightful for a rough bank, and will thrive under trees better than
most shrubby plants. The pretty blue flowers appear for a long time.
There is a variety with prettily variegated leaves. _V. minor_, another
species, is smaller altogether. There are deep-blue and white varieties.

_Weigelas_, 6 to 8 feet. Excellent shrubs for small gardens.


SHRUBS FOR TOWN GARDENS

From the preceding list of shrubs for small gardens a selection suitable
for towns is appended. Many things refuse to live in the smoky and
confined air of towns. This is particularly noticeable in the case of
evergreens; the pores become choked with sooty deposit, and the plant
consequently soon fails, whereas many of those whose leaves are removed
annually are not so seriously affected. Conifers are generally a
failure. This is a small list, but only small gardens are under
consideration.

CHAPTER XXXI

SHRUB AND FLOWER BORDERS


Where there are wide lawn spaces and fine trees in garden ground much of
the effect is often lost or spoiled by the presence of unworthy
trivialities where there should be distinct and bold features. The most
frequent offender is a narrow strip of flower border, edging shrubbery
and coming between the shrubs and the grass. Nothing is more useless
than such a border. The shrubs would look much better coming right down
to the grass, while if bright or distinct colour is absolutely required,
it is easy to make a place here and there where some patch of Lily or
other flower of bold form may be well seen.

These narrow borders are undesirable, not only for their poor effect--we
think not of one, but of many a fine place where there are furlongs of
such futility--but because the plan is destructive to both shrubs and
flowers. If the ground is not dug for a year the roots of the shrubs
invade it; if it is dug and enriched for the flowers, the feeding roots
of the shrubs are mutilated.

In the case of a place where lawn comes up to shrub plantation, which,
again, is backed by woodland, the better way is to have, in just the
right places, a bold planting of something fairly large, whose flower
shall endure for a good while, to let the large group of it come right
through to the lawn, and also stretch away back into the woodland. In
our southern counties, in sheltered places, where the ground is cool and
moist, and at the same time well drained, nothing can be better than
Hydrangeas. Other softer plants for the same treatment would be the fine
_Nicotiana sylvestris_, and for earlier in the year White Foxglove, and
even before that _Verbascum olympicum_. _Lilium auratum_ is also superb
in such places, and _Polygonum Sieboldi_ and others of this fine race of
autumn-blooming plants. If some of the shrubs at the edge of the grass,
such as Azaleas, have beautiful colour at more than one time of the
year, both at the flowering time and in autumn blaze of foliage, two
seasons of beauty are secured.

Hardy Ferns are undeservedly neglected as plants to group about the feet
of shrubs; some of the bolder kinds, as the Male Fern and the Lady Fern,
are charming as a setting to the Lilies that love cool, shady wood
edges.

[Illustration: _TALL EVERGREEN SHRUBS IN A FLOWER BORDER._]

If shrubbery edges were planned with a view to good effect both far and
near, what capital companies of plants could be put together. As one
such example, let us suppose a cool spot, with peaty or light vegetable
soil, planted in the front with _Skimmia_ and hardy Ferns, _Funkia
grandiflora_, and _Lilium rubellum_. A little farther back would come
_Lilium Brownii_, then a group of _Kalmias_ and _Lilium auratum_. One
carefully-planted scheme such as this would lead to others of the same
class, so that the quantities of grand shrubs and plants that are
only waiting to be well used would be made into lovely pictures, instead
of being planted in the usual unthinking fashion, which is without
definite aim, and therefore cannot possibly make any good effect.

We do not, as a rule, plant upright-growing Conifers of the Juniper and
Cypress class in our flower borders, and yet the illustration shows how
this may be done with the very happiest effect. Probably in this case
the trees were there already, and the flower border was wanted, and
therefore was made in circumstances that would not have been specially
arranged at the outset. But it has been done with rare intelligence and
sympathy, and the result is excellent. Here also is seen the best kind
of edge treatment, for the grass is either cut with the scythe or the
plants at the edge are lifted with a stick as the machine runs along, so
that the usual pitiless machine edge is not seen, and the plants at the
side bush out over the grass just as they should do. This is a thing
that is rarely seen well done in gardens.




CHAPTER XXXII

SHRUBS UNDER TREES


It is often a vexed question what to plant under trees when the space is
bare, and sometimes there is an ugly view seen beneath the branches to
shut out. Evergreens are the sheet anchor, relieved with a few deciduous
shrubs grouped amongst them.

Much depends upon the tree, whether a Beech or an Oak, a Maple or a
Chestnut, and so on, as trees vary considerably in their method of
rooting, as well as in the shade they give during the summer months.
This affects the welfare of the plants underneath. Such trees as Oak,
Ash, Plane, Birch, and Horse Chestnut are inclined to root deeply when
they have grown to a fair size, and do not interfere directly with
anything underneath them, although the roots extract much moisture from
the soil.

On the other hand, Beech, Elm, Lime, and Sycamore are more
surface-rooting, and their roots often get entangled with and gradually
kill plants growing near them. Beech and Elm are the greatest offenders,
and grass frequently perishes under these trees. A few liberal soakings
of water in dry weather are beneficial to shrubs or anything else under
trees, but the soakings must be thorough, as mere sprinkles are more
harmful than otherwise. The spread of large tree branches should also
be noticed in summer, as sometimes one or two of the lower ones may be
removed with benefit to the shrubs, judicious cutting away letting in
light and air.

The best of the larger growing evergreens to use under trees are
Laurels, both common and Portugal, Yews, Box, Osmanthus, Aucubas,
Phillyræas, common and oval-leaved Privet, _Ligustrum sinense_, and
_Rhododendron ponticum_. Of these Yews, Box, and Osmanthus are perhaps
as successful as any. The Osmanthus is not usually considered suitable
for this purpose, but it succeeds well in the shade, and keeps a good
dark-green colour. Hollies are sometimes recommended, but, though they
may occasionally thrive under trees, it is not advisable to use many of
them, as they are more often a failure, becoming thin and straggling in
the course of a year or two. Of dwarf-growing evergreens _Berberis
Aquifolium_, Butcher's Broom (_Ruscus aculeatus_ and _R. Hypoglossum_),
_Cotoneaster microphylla_, _Euonymus japonicus_, and _E. radicans_, with
their respective varieties, Skimmias, _Gaultheria Shallon_, Ivies,
especially the common English, Irish Ivy, and Emerald green, _Pernettya
mucronata_, St. John's Wort (_Hypericum calycinum_), and Vincas can all
be recommended, as they all do well in the shade, and most of them will
flower freely.

For a very dry spot where nothing else will grow the Butcher's Broom and
St. John's Wort should be planted, as both will grow and thrive where
other plants die. With deciduous shrubs under trees the difficulty is
not so much in getting them to live as in coaxing them to flower, but a
few of them will do well in the shade, and, as a rule, bloom freely. Of
these the best are the common and White Brooms, _Azalea pontica_,
_Genista virgata_, _Philadelphus_, Forsythias, and _Daphne Mezereum_.
The shrubby Spiræas may also be used sparingly in a fairly light and
open place, though plenty of sun is required as a rule to enable them to
flower properly. In addition, though their flowers are insignificant,
_Cornus alba_ with its red stems in winter, the Snowberry
(_Symphoricarpus racemosus_), which is laden every year with white
berries long after the leaves have fallen.

The question about shrubs growing under trees is so frequently asked
that the names of those most successful are given, but generally the
beauty of the tree is lost when smothered up with evergreens and other
shrubs beneath its spreading branches. A tree is a picture in itself,
and it is pleasant to see the grass creep to the branch edge and then
cease, leaving a brown earth patch under the canopy of foliage.

Shepherdi Holly, Tree Ivies, and _Berberis stenophylla_, it may be
mentioned, are a success under trees.




CHAPTER XXXIII

HARDY SHRUBS IN THE GREENHOUSE


Hardy shrubs have for many years brought colour and fragrance to the
greenhouse in the depth of winter, but we think it is only within recent
years that they have been used in such beautiful variety as at the
present time. The great show of the Royal Horticultural Society in the
Temple Gardens, and many of the delightful fortnightly displays, have
been responsible for much of their present popularity, and the picture
of a group of Plums, Peaches, Almonds, Wistarias, and many other things
in flower long before their natural season, is refreshingly pleasant
when perhaps winter still lingers.

So many shrub families may be used for gently forcing into bloom before
their time that it is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules with
regard to culture. In some cases the plants may be lifted in the autumn,
then potted, and placed out of doors until they are removed under glass,
when the flowers will open in profusion; but the shrubs that can be
treated in this way make dense, fibrous masses of roots, therefore
scarcely feel the check of removal. Some shrubs, however, transplant so
badly that it is needful to grow them entirely in pots.

Shrubs for flowering under glass are grown in large quantities by the
English nurserymen, and very beautiful they are when in flower, bringing
the beauty of early summer to the opening days of spring. Many grow
their plants in pots, the general method being what may be regarded as a
modification of pot culture and planting out, that is to say, although
the plants are potted, and that in fairly large pots, they are plunged
in the open ground over the rim of the pot, and in a position fully
exposed to air and sunshine. Although a few roots may be pushed out over
the rim, and also through the hole in the bottom, this treatment has the
effect of keeping them far more compact than would otherwise be the
case, hence the check of removal is not so great as if they have
unlimited room. This partial confinement of the roots checks a too
luxuriant growth and promotes flower-bud formation.

In the cultivation of shrubs for this purpose, whether they are confined
in pots or planted out, choose an open, well-exposed position, carefully
guarding against overcrowding, as this tends to leaves instead of
flowers. With the same object, they must be kept free from weeds, and
not allowed to suffer from drought.

With few exceptions, the best time to lift and pot the plants is as soon
as possible after the leaves have fallen in the autumn. When done at
this time the young roots recover from the check, and get hold of the
new soil before the flowering season. The pots must be plunged in
leaves, spent hops, or cocoa-nut refuse, to keep them in an even
condition of moisture, and after potting never allow the roots to suffer
through dryness. Whether intended for very early flowering or later on,
the plants should at first only be taken into a comparatively cool
structure, and, if necessary, brought to a greater heat by degrees, and
the lower the temperature, say about 55 degrees, the more beautiful the
flower colouring; while, when they are only required in bloom a little
before the natural season, mere protection from sharp frosts and keen
winds is alone essential. The advantage of early potting is shown
conspicuously in the case of Azaleas. The flowers produced by plants
that have been potted soon after the leaves have fallen will remain
twice as long in beauty as on those not potted until after Christmas.

In a general way, plants that have been forced hard to get them into
flower early cannot be depended upon to bloom satisfactorily the
following season, no matter how carefully they may have been treated,
but those merely brought into bloom a little in advance of those out of
doors will undergo the same ordeal next year. Too often, when the
flowers are over, the shrubs are put away in some corner and forgotten,
and the result is injured leaves and general upset. Shrubs so treated
cannot perform their duties in the year following. Shrubs that have
finished flowering under glass before the time of frost and cold winds
is past should be at first carefully protected and gradually hardened
off. Where a cool house is not available, a frame in a sheltered
position is suitable, but even then avoid overcrowding. By the middle of
May this precaution is not so necessary, although keen frosts and winds
are experienced that would injure foliage developed under glass. Where
potting is necessary, that is, in the case of plants grown permanently
in this way, it should be done before they are placed in their summer
quarters. For this the pots should, if possible, be placed on a firm bed
of ashes and plunged in some moisture-holding material, such as
partially decayed leaves, spent hops, or cocoa-nut fibre refuse.
Occasional doses of liquid manure during the growing season are
beneficial, particularly in the case of shrubs that have not been
re-potted, as the limited amount of nourishment in the soil will have
gone by that time.

The following is a list of the best shrubs for flowering under glass:--

ANDROMEDA (known also as Pieris and Zenobia).--The Andromedas are
beautiful shrubs, with lily-of-the-valley-like flowers, and form such a
mass of fibrous roots that they can be lifted from the open ground and
potted without receiving any check. When placed in a cool house they
flower profusely. The best are _A. floribunda_, which has crowded,
somewhat stiff spikes; _A. japonica_, known by its drooping racemes; and
_A. speciosa pulverulenta_, which has hoary leaves and waxy-white bells.
The first two may be had in flower by the end of March, but the other is
later.

AZALEA.--One of the useful classes of shrubs that we have for this
purpose, quite as valuable for hard forcing as for flowering later in
spring. Although the formation of the roots is dense and wig-like, they
are, as already stated, all the better for being potted early, while
they may be permanently grown in pots in a satisfactory way. The Chinese
_A. sinensis_, or _mollis_, as it is more popularly called, is of close
and compact growth, with massive clusters of large flowers, varying in
colour from pale yellow to deep orange salmon, and innumerable tints and
shades. Among the most beautiful are Alphonse Lavallé, bright orange;
Anthony Koster, deep yellow; Dr. Pasteur, orange red; General Vetten,
orange; Hugo Koster, salmon red; and J. J. de Vink, soft rose. The
varieties grouped under the head of Ghent Azaleas are very beautiful,
and quite as suitable for forcing as the preceding. The individual
flowers are smaller, but they are borne in such profusion that the whole
plant is a mound of blossom. The colour varies from white, through all
shades of yellow, orange, pink, rose, and scarlet, to bright crimson, so
that plenty of variety is available, and some forms have double flowers.
These are not so showy as the single Azaleas. Azaleas, when planted out,
require a certain amount of peat or other vegetable matter in the soil,
and this is even more important when they are grown in pots. A suitable
compost consists of equal parts of loam, leaf-mould, and peat, with half
a part of sand. Very little pruning is needful, and this to consist only
of shortening an occasional shoot that threatens to upset the balance
of the plant, and thinning wiry and exhausted growths; but remove seed
pods directly the flowers are over, as these are a drain upon the
plant's strength.

BERBERIS.--Few Berberises are of much account for greenhouse decoration,
the best being the orange-flowered _B. Darwinii_ and the rich yellow _B.
stenophylla_. They will not flower well if forced hard, but in a cool
house, with very little heat, they are very charming. A successful
grower of shrubs under glass writes: "I knew of some bushes of _B.
stenophylla_ that had been treated in this way for five years, and
little trouble was taken with them, yet they were so beautiful as to be
much admired every year. After flowering, the weakly growths were cut
out and the pots plunged in the open ground. Manure water was
occasionally given, and with this treatment they did well."

CARPENTERIA CALIFORNICA.--This evergreen shrub, even in the south of
England, is all the better for slight protection, and it is delightful
in the almost cold house, the white flowers, reminding one of those of
the Japanese anemone, appearing about May. It is a very beautiful shrub.

CARYOPTERIS MASTACANTHUS.--This Chinese shrub will bloom freely in light
and warm soils, bearing lavender blue flowers in profusion during the
autumn; indeed, so late that when cold and wet weather occurs they often
fail to expand at all. This difficulty is overcome when the plants are
grown in pots and taken into the greenhouse for the flowers to open; it
is then very pretty and much liked. After flowering, the shoots
generally die back almost to the ground, but break up with renewed
vigour in spring.

CEANOTHUS.--Some of the early-flowering Ceanothuses are very valuable;
they may be grown in pots, and their flowers are of pleasing blue
colouring, which is unusual and therefore welcome. Among the best for
this purpose are _C. dentatus_, _C. papillosus_, and _C. veitchianus_.
Ceanothuses do not transplant very well, and if intended for flowering
in pots should be lifted in the autumn, potted carefully, and wintered
in a cool house. They may be kept altogether in pots, giving them much
the same attention during summer as _Berberis stenophylla_.

CERCIS SILIQUASTRUM.--This is the Judas tree, and as many know, while
the leaves are still absent the stems bear clusters of rosy-purple
flowers. It may be lifted and potted in the autumn or kept altogether in
pots, but on no account indulge in hard forcing, as it resents this
treatment. Well-grown specimens are very pretty when in flower in late
March.

CHIONANTHUS.--There are two species of Chionanthus, viz. the North
American Fringe tree (_C. virginica_) and its Japanese representative
_C. retusus_. They resemble each other very much, but the American form
is the better of the two. The Fringe trees are very charming when in
pots. Prune back hard after flowering and fully expose to the sun to
ensure plenty of flower buds. A moist soil is essential.

MEXICAN ORANGE FLOWER (_Choisya ternata_). This will bear its white
fragrant flower clusters in March in a greenhouse, and a succession is
maintained for some time. It is most satisfactory when grown altogether
in pots and plunged outside during the summer.

CLEMATISES.--Of late years the various forms of Clematis have been grown
largely under glass and used for various purposes, not only in the shape
of large specimens, but in pots five inches in diameter, the plant being
secured to a single stake and carrying several big showy flowers. Two
somewhat new continental varieties, Marcel Moser and Nelly Moser, have
proved very useful for this treatment. The plants flowered in small pots
are those that are propagated in the preceding spring and plunged out of
doors during the summer. The Himalayan _C. montana_ that flowers
naturally so early in the season readily responds to a little heat, and
in the greenhouse in spring it is almost as welcome as the New Zealand
_C. indivisa_.

CLETHRA.--Although _C. alnifolia_ does not flower until the autumn it
may be had in bloom in spring. Of course, it will not be so early as
shrubs that are naturally in beauty in the spring, but in May its white,
fragrant flowers should be seen. It requires a cool, moist soil and
sunshine, while prune moderately immediately after flowering. Lifted in
the autumn soon after the leaves drop, it will succeed well.

CORYLOPSIS SPICATA.--This reminds one of a small Hazel bush, and in
early spring before the leaves appear, the drooping clusters of fragrant
yellow flowers appear in profusion; simple protection is all that is
needed to get flowers quite early in the year, when it is very pretty in
the greenhouse. It thrives well kept permanently in pots, or it may be
lifted and potted in the autumn. No pruning is necessary.

CYTISUS (Broom).--The various Brooms are much admired, whether in the
open ground or under glass, and for the latter purpose they must be
established in pots, for their roots are few, descend deeply, and
therefore transplanting is difficult. They will not bear hard forcing,
but in a greenhouse may be had in flower by the end of March, or soon
after. If kept altogether in pots, cut them hard back after flowering to
encourage vigorous shoots for another year. Numerous sorts may be grown
in pots, particularly the Spanish Broom (_C. albus_), the common Broom
(_C. scoparius_), with the hybrid Andreanus and the sulphur-coloured _C.
præcox_.

DEUTZIA.--The pretty _D. gracilis_ is well known as one of the best of
all shrubs for early forcing, and the whole family is of great interest
as pot plants and out of doors. Of these smaller Deutzias some beautiful
hybrids have been raised, particularly _D. Lemoinei_, _D. hybrida
venusta_, and _D. kalmæflora_, all of which may be forced almost, if not
quite, as readily as _D. gracilis_. The old and exhausted shoots of
these Deutzias should, if the shrubs are kept in pots, be cut away to
allow young and vigorous ones to develop. Though they may be had in
flower early, they are much appreciated in the greenhouse, even as late
as the month of May. The larger growing _D. crenata_, with its numerous
varieties, _Candidissima flore-pleno_, _Wellsii_, and _Watererii_ will
not bear hard forcing, but can be had in flower with little trouble in
April and May. Good, well-ripened bushes may be lifted in the autumn,
and if potted and carefully attended to they will flower well the
following spring.

DIERVILLA (WEIGELA).--Many of the Bush Honeysuckles, as the Weigelas are
called, will flower well in a cool house, but they do not last
sufficiently long in bloom to make them of great value for this purpose.
The best is the dark-coloured _Eva Rathke_, which grows naturally into a
neat bush; the flowers are of claret colouring.

HEATHS.--_Erica carnea_ is very pretty in a cool house in mid-winter,
all that is needed being to lift the clumps from the open ground, pot,
and keep watered; while the large-growing Portuguese Heath, _E.
lusitanica_, which flowers naturally in February in the open ground,
when the weather is not too severe, well repays glass protection at that
season.

FORSYTHIA.--The Forsythias flower in the open ground by the month of
March, and indoors, of course, much earlier. The most effective is _F.
suspensa_, which is naturally a climber, or, at all events, of loose and
rambling growth. When needed for pots, tie the principal shoots to a
stout stake, and let the smaller branches grow at will, the result
being a fountain of yellow flowers. After flowering in the greenhouse,
cut back the shoots hard, leaving only an eye or two at the base. These
eyes will break up and produce flowering shoots for another year. By
this method of treatment the same plants may be kept for many years,
provided they are carefully attended to and given occasional doses of
liquid manure during the summer.

HYDRANGEA.--The many varieties of the common Hydrangea are all valuable
for the greenhouse, particularly _Cyanoclada_, _Mariesii_, _Rosea_,
_Stellata_, and Thomas Hogg. To obtain small flowering plants the
cuttings are struck in spring or early summer, grown on freely for a
time, and well ripened by full exposure to air and sunshine before
autumn. Plants grown in this way readily respond to a little heat in the
spring. Larger specimens, too, may be brought on in the same way. The
Japanese _H. paniculata grandiflora_ needs quite different treatment,
the plants being generally grown in the open ground, from whence they
are lifted and potted in the autumn. Before potting prune the long,
wand-like shoots back hard, leaving only about two eyes at the base. By
so doing the plants are kept dwarfer, and the flower heads are larger
than if no pruning were done. By some the Hydrangea is grown as a
standard, and is very effective when in beauty.

ITEA VIRGINICA.--A neat little bush, about a yard high, with dense
spikes of white flowers. It needs a sunny spot in a cool and moist soil,
and under these conditions will flower freely if carefully lifted in
the autumn and potted. It must not suffer from dryness afterwards. No
pruning is necessary.

JAMESIA AMERICANA.--A pretty little white-flowered shrub from the Rocky
Mountains. It will bloom freely under glass, but must not be forced
hard; it may be treated in the same way as the Itea.

KALMIA.--All the Kalmias are good pot shrubs. The roots are dense and
wig-like, reminding one of those of a Rhododendron, so that well-budded
plants can be lifted in the autumn and potted without risk. They must be
brought on gradually in a cool house, and never suffer from want of
water. The earliest to bloom is _K. glauca_, followed by _K.
angustifolia_, while later on there is the largest and best-known
species, _K. latifolia_, the Mountain Laurel of the United States, which
has pretty pink flower clusters.

KERRIA JAPONICA (the Jews' Mallow).--The single Kerria is a twiggy bush,
with bright yellow flowers, like those of a single Rose, and expand
quickly in spring. The major form of the double Kerria is much better
than the ordinary one; they can be potted in autumn or grown permanently
in pots. After the flowering season is over the double variety can be
spurred back hard to prevent a tall weakly growth.

LABURNUM.--This has long been used for the greenhouse, and very
effective it is when well flowered. It is as a rule most successful when
in large pots, in the shape of a standard. Prune back moderately after
flowering.

LONICERA (Honeysuckle).--As _L. fragrantissima_ flowers naturally out of
doors soon after Christmas when the weather is mild, it is evident that
no forcing is needed to obtain it at that season, and in a cool
greenhouse the little white flowers are remarkable for their delicious
perfume. As spring advances the early Dutch may be flowered under glass,
while the scarlet Honeysuckle (_L. sempervirens minor_) is a delightful
greenhouse plant, not used so much as it deserves to be for rafters and
similar purposes in the greenhouse.

LOROPETALUM CHINENSE.--This Chinese shrub, with its long, pure white,
strap-shaped petals, bears much resemblance to the Chionanthus, and is
quite as desirable for flowering in pots. It may be either lifted in the
autumn or grown altogether in pots.

MAGNOLIA.--The Magnolias can be grown under glass. If allowed to come
gradually into bloom in a greenhouse the large flowers will open freely.
As a rule they transplant badly, and for that reason, at least the
choicer ones, are kept in pots for convenience in removal. From this it
will be understood that as a rule it is more satisfactory to keep them
permanently in pots than to lift them in the autumn. _M. purpurea_ can
be grown more easily than any of the others in this form. When grown in
pots for the greenhouse, if they get too large for that structure they
may be planted permanently out of doors and their place taken by smaller
plants. Of those particularly valuable for this treatment are the little
_M. stellata_, a charming shrub; _M. Lenné_, which has massive
chalice-like flowers, rosy-purple outside; _M. conspicua_, _M.
soulangeana_, and _M. purpurea_ among the early Magnolias; and of those
that flower later the Japanese _M. parviflora_ and _M. Watsoni_ do well
in pots.

OLEARIA.--The best known of the Daisy trees of New Zealand is _O.
Haastii_, which flowers freely in August. One at least of the species
blooms naturally much earlier, namely _O. stellulata_ (_O. gunniana_),
and very pretty it is under cover and with its daisy-like blossom. To be
seen at their best, grow them altogether in pots and give the protection
of a cool house in winter.

TREE PÆONIES.--The magnificent varieties of the Tree Pæony that have
appeared in recent years have led to a great increase in their culture.
Though hardy in many places, their young leaves and flowers are
frequently injured by late frosts, hence they are often flowered under
glass. In this way they make a gorgeous display in the greenhouse, which
is sufficiently warm for them in all stages. If forcing is attempted
they are quickly spoilt. They must be potted in good loamy soil, and are
most satisfactory when grown altogether in pots, as many of the long
fleshy roots will be injured in digging up established plants.

PERNETTYA MUCRONATA.--Though grown chiefly for its ornamental berries,
neat little bushes are very pleasing in the greenhouse when thickly
studded with little white lily-of-the-valley-like flowers, so pretty
against the dark-green colouring of the leaves. The treatment
recommended for Kalmias is suitable for the Pernettyas. The fruits are
very charming.

PHILADELPHUS (Mock Orange).--This in its several forms may be lifted in
the autumn and flowered well the following spring, not early, as the
forcing must be very gentle. Even then the perfume of _P. coronarius_ is
too powerful to be pleasant in a confined space. This objection cannot,
however, be urged against M. Lemoine's hybrids between this species and
the pretty little Mexican _P. microphyllus_, which has a fragrance like
that of ripe apples. These newer hybrids--_Avalanche_, _Boule d'Argent_,
_Gerbe de Neige_, _Manteau d'Hermine_, _Mont Blanc_, and _Lemoinei_--are
all worth a place either in the open ground or for flowering in pots.

PRUNUS.--Several classes that were at one time considered as separate
genera are now included in the genus Prunus, which was formerly limited
to the Plum family. Now the Cherries, Almonds, and Peaches are only
sections of the genus Prunus, as explained elsewhere in this book, but
as they are better known under their respective names it will be wiser
to refer to them thus. The Cherries (_Cerasus_) have been added to
considerably of recent years, several varieties having come from Japan,
mostly of _P. (Cerasus) pseudo-cerasus_. These, which include such
varieties as _Sieboldi_, _Watereri_, and J. H. Veitch, all flower freely
when quite small, an important point when considering plants needed for
flowering under glass. Where larger plants are required the double form
of the Wild Cherry (_P. Avium_) is very beautiful. The Almonds flower
early naturally, and under glass, of course, earlier still; the variety
_purpurea_ is one of the best, while a distinct species, _P. (Amygdalus)
davidiana_ and its variety _alba_, are also suitable for growing under
glass. The Peaches (_Persica_) form a delightful group, all available
for flowering under glass; indeed, they respond readily to gentle
forcing, hence may be had in bloom by March. There are several
varieties, the flowers ranging in colour from white, through pink, to
crimson, and double as well as single. One of the finest forms is
_magnifica_, a Japanese variety, semi-double, and brilliant carmine
crimson in colour. The purple-leaved Peach is very charming.

Of the true Plums, special mention must be made of the dark-leaved
variety of the Cherry Plum, known as _Prunus Pissardi_, of the pretty
little _P. japonica alba plena_, and _japonica rosea plena_, more
generally known in gardens as _P. sinensis_, which has slender shoots,
wreathed for the greater part of their length with double rosette-like
flowers, and the charming pink semi-double _P. triloba_. All these forms
of Prunus will, if they have been regularly transplanted, lift well in
the autumn and flower without a check. They are also quite satisfactory
if kept altogether in pots when spurred back after flowering and
encouraged to make free and well-ripened growth during the summer
months, when they should be plunged out of doors in a sunny spot.

PYRUS.--The very beautiful _P. floribunda_ is quite happy under this
treatment, and _P._ or _Cydonia japonica_ (the Japanese Quince) that
flowers early in the year is pretty under glass, especially the distinct
_P. Maulei_, which is of dense and compact growth, and bears salmon-red
flowers in profusion. Grow the Pyruses in a similar way to the Prunuses.

RAPHIOLEPIS JAPONICA (_R. ovata_).--An evergreen of sturdy growth, and
about 3 feet high, with terminal spikes of pure white hawthorn-like
flowers. It is decidedly uncommon and ornamental when in bloom. Out of
doors its season is June, but, of course, is earlier under glass.

RHODODENDRON.--These are the most gorgeous of shrubs, and largely used
for flowering in pots or tubs. They form a dense mat of fibres, and can
therefore be lifted with little check. Owing to this they can, when
ordinary care is used, be transferred to new quarters without losing a
leaf, not only when potted, but also when planted out in the open
ground. Hard forcing must be avoided, but the Rhododendrons may be
brought on gradually in gentle heat. Under this treatment they must be
well supplied with water, and liberal syringing is also beneficial. The
wide range of colouring in the Rhododendron family gives an opportunity
for getting almost any shade desired.

RHODOTYPUS KERRIOIDES.--A beautiful Japanese shrub, reminding one of a
Kerria, but the flowers are white. It will succeed with the same
treatment as the Kerria requires.

RIBES (Flowering Currant).--Both the yellow-flowered _R. aureum_ and the
various forms of _R. sanguineum_ can be brought into flower early under
glass, but the flowers do not last long, and for this reason the shrubs
are little used for the purpose.

SPIRÆAS.--An extensive family, some of which bloom delightfully when
lifted and potted in the autumn and brought into flower in gentle heat.
They may also be grown permanently in pots, but as a rule autumn potting
is preferable. The most popular is _S. confusa_ or _media_, but also
very charming are _S. arguta_, one of the most beautiful of all Spiræas,
_S. Van Houttei_, _S. Thunbergi_, and _S. prunifolia fl. pl._, which all
bear white flowers, those of the last mentioned being double.

STAPHYLEA (Bladder Nut).--_S. colchica_ is most used for forcing, and is
a charming shrub for the purpose. It quickly responds to heat and
moisture. Brought on in a gentle greenhouse temperature, it gives a
wealth of drooping clusters of white fragrant flowers. Keep the shrubs
in pots, as the buds are produced more freely than when planting out is
done, and after the flowers are over prune hard back. There is a hybrid
between _S. pinnata_ and _S. colchica_, called _Columbieri_, which is
better than _S. colchica_.

SYRINGA (Lilac).--The Lilac is one of the most popular of shrubs for
forcing, and may be had in bloom by Christmas or soon after, its flowers
being welcome from then until they appear out of doors. Thousands of
plants for flowering under glass are prepared in the most careful way
every year, the neat bushes, about 2 feet high, having been grown in
pots 7 or 8 inches across and plunged in the open ground. This treatment
results in close and compact balls of soil, which, when turned out of
the pots, retain their shape and bear the journey well. These plants are
pruned hard back after flowering to keep them dwarf. Lilacs that have
been frequently moved may be lifted and flowered without risk. Most of
those sent from Holland consist of the white-flowered variety, _Marie
Legrange_, but the dark-coloured _Charles X._ is also grown. The many
double-flowered Lilacs are not so popular as the singles. It is a pure
delight to smell the flowers of the Lilac long before they appear in the
open garden; they are most welcome.

VIBURNUM.--When the plants are well budded the Laurustinus (_V. Tinus_)
will flower throughout the winter in a greenhouse. Of those that are
amenable to slight forcing the best are the common Guelder Rose (_V.
Opulus sterile_), the Chinese _V. plicatum_, and _V. macrocephalum_.
Treat them in the same way as the Lilac. The Guelder Rose is a
delightful shrub under glass, with its wealth of ivory-white balls. It
is one of the most interesting of all the things that can be brought
into bloom in a greenhouse. Treat the Viburnums in the same way as
recommended for the Lilacs.

WISTARIA.--It is only within the past few years that the Wistaria has
been used to any extent for flowering in this way, but now it is
universally admired. At the exhibitions early in the year it always
attracts more attention than any other shrub grown in a greenhouse; the
soft lilac colouring of the flowers is very beautiful against the tender
green of the expanding leaves. The best and general way is to grow it as
a standard, as the racemes hang down in graceful profusion. _W.
sinensis_ is the Wistaria planted so freely against houses and pergolas,
and for flowering under glass the variety _alba_ may be mentioned; it is
more satisfactory than in the open garden. _W. multijuga_, which has
racemes of great length, may also be tried, but _W. sinensis_ is as
charming as any, and the most likely to give satisfaction. Wistarias
transplant badly, hence in nurseries are usually kept in pots;
therefore, for flowering under glass, permanent pot culture is the
proper treatment. To obtain standards train up a single shoot till the
required height is reached, then stop it, and encourage the formation of
branches. When the head has reached flowering size, after the flowers
are over, spur the shoots back to good eyes to keep the growth fairly
compact.

JAPANESE MAPLES (_Acer palmatum_ and varieties).--The handsome foliage
of the Japanese Maples forms their chief charm. When grown under glass
they are very beautiful, the leaves varying greatly both in colour and
shape; some almost plain, others deeply cut and almost fringe-like.




CHAPTER XXXIV

SHRUB GROUPS FOR WINTER AND SUMMER EFFECT


In the gardens of Lord Aldenham at Elstree an interesting feature is the
grouping of shrubs for summer and winter effect, and some valuable
notes, contributed to the _Garden_ on this subject, may be helpful to
those desirous of getting the best results from both tree and shrub:--

The grouping of suitable subjects, either in the pleasure-ground proper,
on the margin of wood, lake, and stream, and especially so in the
half-wild garden, when carefully carried out, has such a good effect at
all seasons that it is difficult to understand why it is not more
generally done, for only when massed together is it possible to see the
true beauty of many of the commoner hardy shrubs. For some years this
way of planting has been practised at Elstree to a considerable extent,
and the following experience may be helpful to others.

The chief desire here has been to create autumn and winter effect, and
Nature has been of slight assistance to the planter, as the land is not
undulating but generally flat and uninteresting, consequently much
thought and attention have been devoted to attaining the desired object.
No two shrubs grown either for the beauty of their leaves or bark
should be mixed together; the display is more pleasurable when they are
kept apart.

Having determined on the sites to be planted, use white stakes for
marking the outline, and plant boldly. The ground should be thoroughly
trenched, and poor land well enriched with farmyard manure, and the
planting proceeded with either in spring or early autumn. This planting
will apply to dwarf-growing subjects. The deciduous section is dealt
with first.

ARONIA FLORIBUNDA.--A delightful plant when grown as a bush, bearing
sweetly-scented hawthorn-like flowers in May, very effective, and
succeeded by a wealth of deep-purple berries in autumn. This should also
receive an annual pruning during winter or early spring. Allow a
distance of 2 feet 6 inches between the plants, which are well suited
for any purpose. The ground should be kept clean underneath it.

BERBERIS THUNBERGI.--Few deciduous shrubs can excel this for its
beautiful foliage during autumn, and it deserves to be planted more
extensively. In no position is it seen to better advantage than when in
large masses over bold pieces of rock. The shrub should not be pruned,
but allowed to retain its natural habit, and will succeed in almost any
soil. No plant is better adapted for such positions.

BERBERIS VULGARIS PURPUREIS.--This has deep-purple foliage of a very
pleasing shade, and it bears bright-scarlet berries in autumn, succeeds
best on chalky soils, should be cut close to the ground every third
winter, and the soil left undisturbed about the roots. _B. v.
foliis-purpureis_ is remarkable for its very dark purple leaves
throughout the summer. Cut back every spring; it succeeds in poor
ground. _B. aristata_ is very distinct in winter; bark brownish-red. _B.
virescens_ is another charming winter shrub.

COLUTEA ARBORESCENS.--The Bladder Senna may be planted in the half-wild
garden, and will succeed in almost any position and in any soil. Its
yellow flowers in July are pretty, but the seed-vessels during winter
are most effective; it should be pruned back hard annually. There are
several varieties, each of which are equally well adapted for this
purpose. Plant 3 feet apart.

CORNUS SANGUINEA (Dogwood).--Few deciduous shrubs are more easily grown
or more effective during winter than the Scarlet Dogwood. It may be
grouped in any position either in the gardens or outside when of any
extent, and when space is no object the beds or groups can hardly be too
large. The foliage attains a beautiful bronze tint during autumn, but
unfortunately soon falls. The position should be open, and it is
absolutely essential that the growths be cut to the ground annually the
first week in April, bearing in mind that it is only the young wood
which puts on its brightly-coloured robe in winter, and the more intense
the cold the better colour will be the wood. Plant 3 feet apart. _Cornus
sanguinea variegata_ is a beautiful silver variegated form of the above,
but not so vigorous. It is very fine for summer decorations, and should
be much more appreciated. Plant at a distance of 18 inches and prune
annually. The scarlet wood, though small, is very pretty in winter, but
not showy enough in the distance. _Cornus alba Spathi_ has beautiful
golden foliage in the summer, and does not lose its brightness in the
hottest years. Requires the same treatment as the above.

CORYLUS MAXIMA ATROPURPUREA.--One of our best purple-leaved plants,
especially so in early summer. Arrange to plant this near _Acer negundo
variegata_, _Sambucus nigra aurea_, or both, and the effect will be
good. It will succeed on almost any kind of well-trenched ground. Plant
the shrubs 3 feet apart, and they will require little attention, but
every fifth year the shoots should be cut clean to the ground, when the
growth and foliage will be much more robust and telling.

COTONEASTER SIMONSII.--A strong-growing shrub, and suitable for making
large groups; it is very effective during autumn and winter when studded
with its red berries. It should be planted 3 feet apart and not pruned,
but about every fifth year it should be cut close to the ground.

CYTISUS ALBUS, the Common White Broom; _Cytisus scoparius_, the Common
Yellow Broom; and the effective although newer variety, _C. scoparius_,
_andreanus_, are all delightful plants when extensively planted, not
only when in flower, but their fresh-looking green wood is pleasing at
all seasons. Plant early in April 3½ feet apart, using small plants.
None of the Brooms like being cut back to the hard wood, but the young
growths may be shortened back after flowering. _C. præcox_ is perhaps
the best of the whole family, flowering profusely, and is of good habit.
It should be planted 4 feet apart, and the strong growths pegged down in
the soil.

DAPHNE MEZEREUM and the white variety _album_ are among our earliest and
most beautiful flowering shrubs; _Autumnale_ is excellent, it blooms in
late autumn. They should be planted 4 feet apart, either immediately
after flowering or in very early autumn, both flourishing best on light
soils.

DIMORPHANTHUS MANDSCHURICUS (syn. _Aralia mandschurica_).--This fine
tropical-looking plant, when planted in large beds, forms a magnificent
feature during the summer months, and in the winter the stems when bare
are both curious and interesting. It enjoys a deep rich soil, and is
easily propagated from root suckers. Plant at a distance of 5 feet
apart.

EUONYMUSES.--The true variety of _Euonymus alatus_ must rank as one of
the most valuable plants for autumn effect. Words can hardly describe
its beautiful tints. It is a slow grower, but will succeed in almost any
kind of soil. Plant 3 feet apart. _E. europæus_ (the Spindle tree)
should be planted in large beds or masses at a distance of 4 feet apart,
and pruned annually. It deserves a place by any woodland walk or in the
half-wild garden. Thus treated it will fruit most freely, and its
pretty pink berries hanging in thick bunches are sure to attract
attention. The white variety, though as pretty, does not fruit so
freely.

FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA.--This is most effective when planted in any position
in the gardens or grounds. It makes a delightful bed when planted at a
distance of 4 feet apart, and should not be pruned. _F. viridissima_,
though not such a pretty kind as the above, is equally well suited; it
flowers profusely. Both of these flower during March and April. The
surface-soil should be pricked over every spring.

FUCHSIA RICCARTONI.--This charming old shrub makes magnificent beds in
any part of the grounds. It should be cut down close to the ground every
spring and receive a mulching of half-decayed manure. This is not
planted half so largely as it deserves to be.

HYDRANGEA PANICULATA GRANDIFLORA.--This is perfectly hardy, and few
flowering shrubs are more admired during autumn when in large beds. They
should be planted in a deep rich soil, in a moist position, 3 feet
apart, and pruned back hard annually at the end of March. We have some
which were planted sixteen years ago and have never once failed to make
a splendid display. The surface-soil should be pricked over early in
spring.

HIPPOPHAË RHAMNOIDES (the Sea Buckthorn).--This will succeed well in any
deep moist soil. Its beautiful grey foliage shows up well during summer,
and when the male and female plants are mixed together the branches will
be wreathed with clusters of beautiful orange-coloured berries during
autumn and winter. Plant 5 feet apart and somewhat in the background.
Very little pruning will be required, except to regulate the growths.
Prick over the surface-soil annually. The Sea Buckthorn also lends
itself admirably for planting by the sides of lakes and streams or at
the back of rock-work.

HYPERICUMS.--_H. Androsæmum_ grows to the height of 2 feet 6 inches, and
is sure to be appreciated. Its flowers appear profusely during summer,
and are followed by clusters of dark-brown berries. Plant 2 feet apart
and prune close to the ground annually early in April. _H. calycinum_
(the Common St. John's Wort) is partly evergreen and admirably suited
for clothing banks or making beds where low-growing subjects are
required; it will flourish anywhere, and should be cut close to the
ground with the shears annually. _H. moserianum_ is one of the best of
this class of plants, but needs some protection in cold districts. _H.
patulum_ is also an excellent variety, and not so extensively planted as
it deserves.

KERRIA JAPONICA.--A charming compact-growing shrub, with single
bright-yellow flowers. It is suitable for small beds or grouping in the
front of shrubberies. There is a variegated variety which is liable to
revert back to the green form, but such shoots should be kept cut out.
Very little if any other pruning is required; a poor, light, sandy soil
suits it best.

LEYCESTERIA FORMOSA.--A delightful shrub for massing in the wilderness
or wild garden; requires a deep rich soil. Its large purple and white
flowers in August and September are very pleasing, and during autumn and
winter the wood is very conspicuous, being bright green. It should be
pruned back annually, and the ground pricked over in spring. Plant at a
distance of 4 feet apart.

LONICERA (HONEYSUCKLE), LARGE DUTCH.--To see this beautiful climbing
plant at its best, make a mound of tree roots, fill in with soil, and
plant at a distance of 4 feet apart. At first the growths will require
to be trained and nailed over the roots, and when once covered they will
need little other attention. Large beds planted in this way will be sure
to be highly appreciated, if for nothing else, for the fragrance of the
flowers.

LYCIUM CHINENSE.--Commonly called Box Thorn or Tea Tree; should be
planted in large groups where it can ramble away near the water or
overhang large roots of trees or boulders. Except to regulate the
growths once a year, it will give no further trouble. There are several
other varieties well suited for the same purpose.

PYRUS JAPONICA.--This well-known early-flowering shrub may be grouped in
almost any position, but is seen to the best advantage when on raised
ground or overhanging masses of rock. It should not be pruned, but
allowed to retain its natural habit. Plant at a distance of 4 feet
apart. The variety _carnea_ is equally good, but bears more freely; the
fruits make excellent preserve, while the flowers are a beautiful flesh
colour. _C. Maulei_ is quite distinct from the above, but quite as
valuable, and flowers and fruits freely.

RHUS COTINUS (Venetian Sumach), the Smoke Plant or Wig Tree, is one of
the most effective shrubs for this purpose. A large mass of this, with
its delightfully-tinted foliage in autumn, is a pleasing picture, and is
well adapted for any position or any part of the garden. It should be
planted in deep but poor soil, at a distance of 5 feet apart, and
slightly pruned annually early in April; it requires no other attention.
_R. typhina_ (the Stag's-Horn Sumach) is one of the commonest plants
grown, with not much beauty, except when planted in large beds and cut
close to the ground annually. When treated in this way few things are
more attractive; it then throws up strong, vigorous shoots, with fine
tropical-looking foliage, which is highly attractive during summer, and
the colouring of the foliage during autumn is most conspicuous, also of
the wood during winter. When stripped of its foliage it is distinct and
pleasing; it will flourish in any soil. Plant 3 feet apart, and it is
easily propagated by root suckers.

ROSA RUGOSA.--This charming Rose, when planted in the wilderness, wild
garden, or around the lake, in large beds or masses, is always seen to
advantage; it has fragrant flowers in summer, and large, highly-coloured
fruit in autumn. Place it in the forefront of flowering plants. Plant in
deep, well-enriched soil, at a distance of 4 feet apart, and prune, like
other Roses, annually. The white variety is equally well adapted, and
may be mixed with the above.

ROSA BENGALE HERMOSA, belonging to the monthly or China section, is one
of the freest flowering and most charming of all Roses. In mild autumns
it flowers freely until Christmas when planted in sheltered positions.
It enjoys a rich soil, and should be pegged down annually, merely
thinning out the growths in spring. May go in any part of the garden or
grounds, and it is perhaps unequalled for covering southern slopes.
Fellenberg is exceptionally free also.

ROSA RUBIGINOSA (the Sweet Briar).--Every woodland walk, wilderness, or
wild garden should have one bed or more of this fragrant plant. The
delicious scent emitted from its foliage in spring after showers is very
welcome, and the bushes, when heavily laden with the bright-red fruits
in autumn and winter, are most effective. This should be planted at a
distance of 3 feet apart in well-trenched and heavily-manured ground,
and clipped over every spring.

RUBUS.--Nearly the whole of these may be freely grouped. Only those most
successful at Elstree are mentioned: _R. biflorus_ (the white-washed
Bramble) is one of the most distinct and effective of the whole class.
During winter it looks as if it had been painted white, and when planted
close to the Scarlet Dogwood is exceedingly attractive in the distance.
It succeeds best on a good deep loam, and the old growths should be cut
out every winter. Plant at a distance of 4 feet apart. _R. canadensis
rosea_ (the flowering Raspberry) is invaluable for making large beds. It
continues to produce its highly-coloured flowers freely all through the
summer and autumn. Plant 3 feet apart and thin out the old growths
annually. _R. ulmifolius roseo flore-pleno_, also the white form _alba_
(the double-flowered Blackberry), may be grouped on slopes. The old
growths should be cut out annually, and plant 4 feet apart. _R.
laciniata_ (American Blackberry) is the best of the fruiting kinds for
this purpose; it produces large crops of valuable fruit every year.
Treat in the same way as advised for the above. _R. phoenicolasius_ (the
Japanese Wineberry). This somewhat new form of Rubus is one of the best
plants for this kind of planting. It bears freely, and the fruits are
much appreciated by many, and its bright canes during winter produce a
most pleasing effect. It is a strong grower when planted in good soil at
a distance of 5 feet apart. Remove all the old canes during winter. The
ordinary garden forms of Raspberry also make fine groups in the unkept
parts of the grounds. The old growths should be pruned out each autumn,
when the young canes have a warm and pleasing appearance.

SALIX.--Many of the Willows form splendid features during the winter
months. Perhaps on a fine winter's day large masses of the
highly-coloured barked Willows can hardly be excelled for their beauty
and rich colouring, but, of course, are only adapted for waterside
planting or low, wet, marshy land. Nothing is more readily propagated
from cuttings than these. They should be planted 3 feet apart, and the
young growths pruned hard to the ground annually the last week in March,
for it must be borne in mind that any wood more than twelve months old
has very little, if any, beauty in it. The most important for the beauty
of their wood are _Salix vitellina_, the golden-barked Willow, _S. alba
britzensis_, warm, orange-coloured bark, very beautiful, _S. cardinalis_
(which has bright-red bark), and _S. purpurea_, purple. Though the last
mentioned is not so effective in the distance as the foregoing, it is
well worthy of cultivation. Only one other Willow will be mentioned; it
should be planted for its summer beauty, that is _S. rosmarinifolia_.
Its beautiful grey foliage much resembles that of Rosemary. It is not so
robust a grower as many of the family, and there is no beauty in the
wood during winter, consequently the growths should only be shortened
back to within three eyes of the base annually.

SAMBUCUS.--The Elder family, like the preceding, is a large one, and
fortunately adapts itself to almost any soil and situation. First and
foremost must be mentioned _Sambucus nigra aurea_, a bold and beautiful
tall-growing Elder, and its rich golden foliage produces a marvellous
effect in the landscape. Large bold masses of this should always be used
where practical in a half-open position. Hard pruning in this case must
be carried out, cutting the summer's growth close to the ground annually
in the last week of March. The effect of the greenish-grey wood in
winter when treated in this way is pleasing; the silvery variegated
form, though not so showy, is worthy of a place where the grounds are
extensive. Should be planted on poor soil in an open position, and
pruned hard annually. _S. n. laciniata_ (the Parsley-leaved Elder) is a
beautiful and distinct form of the cut-leaved Elder, which attains its
true character and makes splendid beds; it requires the same kind of
treatment as to pruning as the above. _S. racemosa foliis aurea_ is
unquestionably the finest variety in cultivation, and one would like to
see it more often in our gardens, but there seems to be an unreasonable
prejudice against golden-leaved shrubs, however beautiful. It does best
on a deep rich soil in a fully-exposed position, and prune back hard
early in April. The cuttings should be propagated in pots in a cold
frame. The whole of the Elders should be planted 3 feet apart.

SPARTIUM JUNCEUM (the Spanish Broom).--Flowers in early autumn and lasts
a considerable time. Its bright-yellow blooms are very telling in the
distance. Plant 4 feet apart, and prune after flowering.

[Illustration: _SPIRÆA CANESCENS (syn. flagelliformis)._]

SPIRÆAS.--Another beautiful and interesting class for effect either in
summer or winter, when sufficiently large plantations are made and
properly treated. The whole of these should be planted at a distance of
2 feet apart, on deeply-trenched and well-manured ground. The North-West
American _Spiræa Douglasi_, though one of the most common, is
unsurpassed for its distinct and beautiful wood during autumn and
winter, but the only way to see it at its best is to cut it clean to the
ground every year during the last week in March. It will then produce
young strong growths from 4 to 5 feet in height, each of which will
furnish fine heads of deep-pink flowers during summer, and its
beautiful, warm-looking, nut-brown wood in winter is among the most
richly toned of all the barks which are used to produce effect, and yet
when grown in the ordinary way, and partially pruned down, as we in
nearly all cases see it, it produces miserable flowers, and the wood is
uninteresting. About every third or fourth year after pruning give a
surface dressing of half-decayed manure and loam in equal proportions.
The prunings should be tied up and saved for staking purposes; they are
of the utmost value for all kinds of slender-growing plants. _S.
callosa_ also makes a fine bed, and is very effective during late
summer; its large heads of deep-pink flowers render it most conspicuous;
they are produced when the others are past their best. It should be cut
to the ground every third year. _S. prunifolia flore-pleno_ is a very
beautiful form, flowers freely in March and April, and its foliage
assumes lovely tints in the autumn. It is of very graceful habit, and
well suited for banks or overhanging rocks. It should be moderately
pruned each year, and when it attains to a leggy appearance cut hard
back. _S. canescens_ (syn. _flagelliformis_) makes splendid beds owing
to the pretty arrangement of the foliage. This should be pruned to the
ground annually.

SYMPHORICARPUS RACEMOSUS (the Common Snowberry) is generally regarded as
an almost worthless plant, but when in a sunny open position on
well-trenched land and cut close to the ground each year, large beds are
most attractive in autumn and winter, as by such treatment the growths
will become thickly studded with pure white fruits. _S. orbiculatus
variegatus_ is a very pretty, somewhat slow-growing golden-leaved shrub,
and should be planted in an open position. It has a tendency to revert
back to the green form. Shoots of the type should be kept cut away. This
should be slightly pruned in spring, and when leggy cut to the ground.


EVERGREENS

BERBERIS (syn. MAHONIA) AQUIFOLIUM, or Holly-leaved Barberry, is too
well known to need much description. It is one of the most useful and
accommodating of shrubs, and will succeed in almost any soil, and either
in the open or under the shade of trees is quite at home. For clothing
banks few things can equal it, and when thus used should be pruned close
to the ground after flowering. It should be planted when in a small
state 18 inches apart, choosing the beginning of April for the purpose.
It should be cut to the ground each year after planting.

BOX.--The entire Box family is excellent for grouping when the soil is
suitable, but it is waste of time to attempt planting it in large
quantities unless the position and soil agree with it. A light surface,
with a chalky subsoil, is what it enjoys.

LAURELS.--The two best Laurels are _Prunus Laurocerasus caucasica_, the
hardiest of the whole family, and _rotundifolia_. The former may be
severely pruned and is excellent for clothing large bare places,
mounds, or banks; _rotundifolia_ is a splendid variety with larger
foliage, but not so hardy. The ground in which these Laurels are to be
planted should be trenched or bastard trenched, and small plants be
planted 3 feet apart all ways. To keep them in condition, prune hard
down during the growing season twice, if not three times, when they will
remain in good health for many years. _Prunus lusitanica_ (Portugal
Laurel) is happy in heavy soils, and its beautiful dark-green leaves are
very telling. This should also be planted in trenched ground at a
distance of 5 feet apart, and pruned once only during the year. So
treated, splendid beds are formed when suitable positions are chosen.

COTONEASTER BUXIFOLIA or WHEELERI, is a fine strong-growing evergreen
for almost any soil. It is well adapted for making beds, covering large
boulders or the old roots of trees, and for covering ugly iron fencing.
_C. buxifolia_ is a graceful and pleasing plant when covered with its
bright berries, and allowed to assume its natural habit. Plant 3 feet
apart, merely thinning out the growths occasionally.

COTONEASTER MICROPHYLLA.--A very charming shrub, and when planted on a
raised position, or on overhanging rocks, tree roots, and such like,
forms beautiful masses, especially when thickly studded with its crimson
berries. It sometimes becomes badly infested with brown scale, but this
is easily got rid of by applying a strong solution of soft soap and
water with a syringe.

ILEX AQUIFOLIUM (the Common Holly).--The Holly is one of the very finest
of our evergreens for bold planting. Fortunately, it is one of the few
evergreens that will succeed and grow luxuriantly under the drip of
trees, where many other things fail. Large breadths of Holly in good
health are a pleasure to look at at all seasons of the year,
particularly when well laden with bright-scarlet berries. The Holly is
seen at its best on light, well-drained soils, that of a stiff clayey
nature (especially so when water-logged) being the most unfavourable to
its growth. Fortunately, it will adapt itself to any mode of pruning,
but unquestionably the best way to treat it is to plant in large bold
clumps, allowing it to grow away at its own sweet will. Many of the more
uncommon varieties, both green and variegated, make highly attractive
groups and beds, and where expense is of little object should most
certainly be planted.

RHODODENDRONS.--Of course, one must possess a suitable soil to plant the
more beautiful varieties in any quantity; nevertheless, the common _R.
ponticum_ and hybrid seedlings, of which there are now fortunately a
great variety, will succeed in nearly all soils free from lime. The
ground should be thoroughly broken up during autumn, and the planting
done 4 feet apart in the spring. The seed-vessels should be picked off
after flowering, and the plants are much benefited by an occasional
top-dressing of road grit and leaf soil. Even here on a cold London
clay, where the ground has been well drained and treated as above, they
succeed very well.

RUSCUS ACULEATUS (Butcher's Broom), a native of this country, is
invaluable for planting in shady, sheltered spots. It appears to enjoy
the drip from other trees, and is very accommodating as to soil and
position, but likes to remain undisturbed. _Ruscus racemosus_, which is
a native of Portugal, and commonly called the Alexandrian Laurel, is
unquestionably the best of the Ruscus family, and its growth very much
resembles that of the Bamboo. It is rarer than the commoner kinds, but
it deserves extended cultivation, being worth a good position in any
part of the gardens or grounds. It berries freely in some seasons. It
lasts remarkably well, and is very handsome in a cut state. It enjoys a
deep rich loam, but will not fail to give a good account of itself on
any soil.

JUNIPERUS SABINA TAMARISCIFOLIA is a beautiful shrub for the fringe of a
plantation, it is of robust growth, and the best of the Junipers for
this planting.

TAXUS BACCATA AUREA _variegata_ and _elegantissima_ (the Golden Yew) are
most effective evergreen shrubs. They should be planted in open sunny
positions. Without doubt _elegantissima_ has no rival, being the most
useful and telling golden evergreen shrub we have. It is of somewhat
slow growth, consequently should be planted fairly thick. Like the
Common Green Yew, it succeeds in almost any kind of soil, but it colours
best on a deep yellow loam in a thoroughly exposed position.

ULEX EUROPÆUS (Common Gorse or Whin).--This common British plant needs
little description here. When seen in its wild state, where it is
thoroughly naturalised, it presents a most charming sight. Half-wild
patches of land may easily be made suitable for it at little expense.
During winter the land should either be ploughed or dug, and the seed
sown during April, either in drills or broadcast, and the seedlings
thinned to a fair distance apart during the following spring. When once
thoroughly established, little trouble will be experienced in keeping
the ground well stocked. Occasionally, when the old plants become leggy,
they should be cut close to the ground immediately after flowering, and
in a short time these will break away freely from the bottom. _Ulex
europæus flore-pleno_ is an invaluable plant for all kinds of ornamental
planting, and is struck from cuttings, which are potted up. In this way
the plants are distributed; nevertheless, it is a most important plant
to have. The flower is a much brighter yellow than the common form, is
produced more freely, and lasts a considerable time in beauty. It is
very suitable for either making beds or forming large patches of colour
behind rocks and among the fissures of the rock garden. It should be
planted about 3 feet apart, in fairly good ground, and about every fifth
year pruned down close to the ground.

VIBURNUM TINUS (_Laurustinus_).--A beautiful evergreen flowering shrub,
and generally well known, but unfortunately it is not sufficiently hardy
to plant in many parts of the country, especially in exposed positions.
It will grow and flower profusely in very shallow and, indeed, in almost
any soil. It makes a handsome bed, and should be planted 4 feet apart.

The Hon. Vicary Gibbs has taken keen interest in the tree and shrub
planting in the gardens of Aldenham House.




CHAPTER XXXV

THE USE OF HARDY CLIMBING SHRUBS[2]


The best and best known of our good hardy climbing shrubs are by no
means neglected, but yet they are not nearly as much or as well used as
they might be. Such a fine thing as the easily-grown _Clematis montana_
will not only cover house and garden walls with its sheets of lovely
bloom, but it is willing to grow in wilder ways among trees and shrubs,
where its natural way of making graceful garlands and hanging ropes of
bloom shows its truest and best uses much better than when it is trained
straight along the joints of walls or tied in more stiffly and closely.
Even if there are only a few stiff bushes such as Gorse or low Thorns to
support and guide it, it gladly covers them just as does the Traveller's
Joy (_Clematis Vitalba_) of our chalkland hedges. This climber, though a
native plant and very common in calcareous soils, is worthy of any
garden. _C. V. rosea_ is a very fine variety. _Clematis Flammula_ is
another of the family that should be more often treated in a free way,
and grown partly trained through the branches of a Yew or an Ilex. The
less-known _Clematis orientalis_, with yellow flowers and feathery
seeds, and the fine October-blooming _C. paniculata_, make up five
members of one family, apart from the large-flowered Clematises, that
all lend themselves willingly to this class of pictorial treatment.

[Illustration: _CLEMATIS MONTANA OVER ROUGH WALL._]

One of the most important of our climbing shrubs, the _Wistaria_, makes
grand growth in all the south of England. This also can be used to
excellent effect trained into some rather thinly-furnished tree such as
an old Acacia. Its grey snake-like stems and masses of bloom high up in
the supporting tree are shown to excellent effect. This is also a fine
plant for a pergola. A few plants growing free and rambling full length
would, after the first few years, when they are getting old, cover a
pergola from end to end. The piers or posts could also be covered with
the same, for though the nature of the plant is to ramble, yet if kept
to one stem and closely pruned it readily adapts itself to pillar form,
and bears a wonderful quantity of bloom.

[Illustration: _CLEMATIS MONTANA OVER ARCHWAY._]

Among the Grape Vines there is a great variety of ways of use other than
the stiff wall training they generally receive. If they are wanted for
fruit they must be pruned, but most outdoor Vines are grown for the
beauty of their foliage. Here is another first-class pergola plant,
making dense leafy shade, and growing in a way that is delightfully
pictorial. Nothing looks better rambling over old buildings. Now that so
many once prosperous farms are farms no longer, and that their
dwelling-houses are being converted to the use of another class of
occupier, the rough out-buildings, turned into stabling, and adapted for
garden sheds, often abut upon the new-made pleasure-garden. This is the
place where the Vines may be so well planted. If the main stem only is
trained or guided it is well to leave the long branches to shift for
themselves, for they will ramble and dispose themselves in so pictorial
a way that the whole garden is bettered by their rioting grandeur of
leaf mass.

_Aristolochia Sipho_, with its twining stems and handsome leaves, will,
like the Vine and the Virginian Creeper, answer to all these uses of
jungle-like growth among trees and shrubs and free climbing in hedge,
over pergola or rough building.

The employment of the climbing and rambling Roses is also now understood
for all such uses, and the illustration shows the value of the Dutch
Honeysuckle for this purpose.

A rough hedge containing perhaps only a few Thorns and Hollies and stub
Oaks, and a filling of Wild Brambles, may be made glorious with the free
hardy climbers just guided into the bushes and then left to ramble as
they will.

In the growth of the rarer and most distinct and beautiful of climbing
shrubs one must in the main be guided by the natural surroundings of
soil and shelter or by climatic conditions. In the cold midland and
northern districts of England we have seen common Laurels and many Roses
killed to the ground during severe winters.

In Hampshire, Devon, and Cornwall, and in many other isolated and
sheltered nooks near the sea in England south of the Thames, many
so-called cool greenhouse plants often grow and thrive luxuriantly in
the open air. This is also true of many localities in the south and west
of Ireland, such as Fota, Cork, Bantry, and Tralee, where New Zealand,
Japanese, Californian, and many Chilian shrubs are quite happy in the
open air. Nearly all visitors to Glengarriff notice the luxuriance of
the Fuchsias, which, not being cut down there every winter by severe
frosts, assume more or less of a tree-like aspect, and are literally one
mass of brilliant coral-red flowers during summer and autumn. But it is
even more wonderful to see there growing up the front of the hotels and
elsewhere such plants as _Maurandya_, _Lophospermum_, _Mikania_, and
Cape Pelargoniums year after year. But, apart from mild climates, aspect
has an enormous effect on many climbing shrubs, and especially on light
dry soils. _Lapageria_, for example, prefers a northern exposure, and
the same is true of _Berberidopsis corallina_, and the remarkable
_Mutisia decurrens_. Many climbers and trailers, again, are hardy on
north or north-western walls that are ruined by bright sunshine after
frost, which is often experienced on south and especially south-western
exposures. Even when climbers like _Wistaria_, _Jasminum nudiflorum_,
_Ceanothus_, _Pyrus_ and many others are perfectly hardy on sunny walls
it is often a great advantage to train a few branches over the top of
the wall to the shady side, as in these cases there is a week or ten
days or more difference in the time of blooming, and so an agreeable
succession is obtained.

In planting both walls and pergolas there is danger in planting too
thickly, and in planting too hurriedly or without sufficient
preparation. We all must perforce often do the best we can rather than
the best we know. Large-growing, permanent shrubs, such as _Pyrus
japonica_, _Wistaria_, and _Magnolias_, which may remain in the same
spot for twenty years or more, often fail through starvation, and in any
case never attain their full luxuriance and beauty if cramped and
stunted during the first few years after planting. Again, it must be
remembered that both wall and pergola creepers often suffer from dryness
during the summer and autumn months, and provision should be made for
necessary mulching and watering.

There is one important point that must be attended to in the planting of
anything of which the general hardiness is not fully assured, and that
is, never plant late in autumn. The golden rule with all half-hardy
things is to plant well in April or May, after all danger from severe
frost, &c., is over, so as to allow the plants a long summer and autumn
season of root and top-growth before the stress and strain of winter
weather come upon them. In this way many plants will succeed perfectly
in establishing themselves that would at once die off if planted out in
October or November.

ABELIA.--_A. floribunda_ is a Mexican plant. Mr. Burbidge writes in the
_Garden_, April 14, 1900, p. 272: "I have seen it very handsome in
flower on a low wall at Mount Usher, county Wicklow. Its pendent
flowers in axillary clusters are of a rich purple red, and remind one of
some Fuchsias." _A. chinensis_, a Chinese plant, is very pretty, as also
is _A. triflora_ from North India.

ABUTILON.--Several of the Abutilons are sufficiently hardy to thrive on
walls or in borders near to heated plant-houses. Mr. Burbidge writes in
the _Garden_: "I have seen _A. striatum_, _A. vexillarium_, and _A.
vitifolium_ grow and bloom for years outside. The last-named forms a
spreading bush 10 to 13 feet high in South, West, and Eastern Ireland.
It has leaves somewhat resembling those of the Grape Vine, and clusters
of pale-lilac, mauve, or lavender-tinted flowers that remind one of
those of _Meconopsis Wallichi_ in shape, size, and colour. _A.
vitifolium_ comes from Chili, and enjoys shelter and ample root
moisture, being apt to suffer from drought near walls, otherwise it
grows well thereon." _Abutilon vexillarium_, when afforded the
protection of a south wall, blooms for eight months out of the twelve,
bearing on slender, curving shoots its handsome, bell-shaped flowers
with their crimson sepals, yellow petals, and protruding dark-brown
stamens well into the month of December should no severe frost occur.
Florists' varieties of the Abutilon, such as Boule de Neige, also do
well on sheltered walls.

ADLUMIA CIRRHOSA.--This grows quickly, and the fern-like leaves,
covering almost the twining stems, possess much beauty; the flowers are
white. A biennial, but sows itself freely. North America.

AKEBIA QUINATA.--A most distinct Japanese creeper with five-lobed
leaves and twining stems; although generally grown in a greenhouse,
where it flowers in January or February, it is quite hardy in mild
sea-shore places, and bears its monoecious flowers in April or May. The
rich wine-purple flowers are borne in axillary grape-like clusters, and
their translucent petals are very beautiful as seen between the eye and
the light. It likes a rich, deep, loamy soil, and is increased by
suckers or layers. Although introduced to our gardens from Chusan in
1845, it has never become very abundant, but it deserves a place for its
distinctive character.

ALOYSIA CITRIODORA (Sweet Verbena).--Another popular name for the
_Aloysia_ is Lemon plant; it is a fragrant pale-green leaved bush, not
very hardy, and therefore best placed when against a sunny wall. Except
in quite the south of England and Ireland, it is generally wise to cover
over the stems with a straw mat and heap ashes over the roots. It is
often seen as a large bush against the sea. We have seen it thus on the
Carnarvon coast. Chili.

AMPELOPSIS.--Now included with the Vines (_Vitis_).

APIOS TUBEROSA.--This has pea-shaped violet-scented flowers. It is
sometimes pretty rambling over a shrub. North America.

ARISTOLOCHIA SIPHO (Dutchman's Pipe).--Frequently planted against a
wall; its leaves are very large and handsome, and the dull-coloured
flowers, owing to their shape, have given rise to the popular name.

ATRAGENE ALPINA.--A hardy wall climber, and known under the name of
_Clematis alpina_. It enjoys a lime soil. A native of Europe.

AZARA.--The best known of these is _A. microphylla_; it is not one of
the hardiest of shrubs, but in many gardens, especially where sheltered
and by the sea, it covers much space with dense glossy leaves; the
flowers are white, small, and give place to orange-coloured berries in
autumn. It is quite a shrubby wall plant.

BENTHAMIA FRAGIFERA.--Now known as _Cornus capitata_, but in gardens its
old name will long be retained. In Devon, Cornwall, and in Wicklow,
Cork, and Kerry, and elsewhere in Ireland, this fine shrub flowers and
fruits luxuriantly as a bush on the border or lawn, but in less favoured
places it needs the warmth and shelter of a wall. It is a native of
Nepaul, and is readily increased from home-grown seeds, and the plant,
like all its allies, is a rapid grower in any deep, rich, loamy soil.
Quite small bushes of this plant and the common _Arbutus Unedo_ are
often very handsome as seen laden with fruit in South and Western
Ireland.

BERBERIDOPSIS CORALLINA.--Mr. Burbidge writes in the _Garden_: "The
finest specimen of this beautiful and distinct evergreen climber I ever
saw was on the stable wall at Lakelands, Cork, when that noble place was
in the hands of the late Mr. William Crawford, a great lover of garden
vegetation. It is a native of the Chilian Andes, introduced in 1862. It
likes a deep peaty soil or loam and leaf-mould on a moist bottom, and,
like the _Lapageria_ and its dwarf cousin _Philesia_, it enjoys a
northern or shaded aspect, rarely thriving for long together in full
sunshine. Its flowers resemble those of the Berberis, but are much
larger, have pendent stalks, and are of the brightest coral-red or blood
colour. It grows and flowers here in a shaded corner under an ivy-topped
wall."

BIGNONIA CAPREOLATA.--This is the hardiest of the Bignonias. It needs a
warm wall, and there is much beauty in the warm, reddish-orange,
trumpet-shaped flowers, which are in clusters from April to August. It
grows to a considerable height. North America.

BILLARDIERA LONGIFLORA.--This is the Apple Berry of Tasmania, and is of
elegant twining habit, its greenish-yellow flowers, which are not very
showy, being succeeded by handsome blue berries that are very
ornamental, and are similar in shape and size to Fuchsia fruits. The
plant is closely related to the _Pittosporums_ of New Zealand, and grows
2 or 3 feet in height. There are two or three other kinds, but none
prettier than _B. longiflora_. It grows best in moist peat and
sandstone, at the foot of a half-shaded wall.

CALYSTEGIA.--Also known as Convolvulus. _C. pubescens fl. pl._, the
double Bindweed, is more useful for rough stumps than walls, but may be
included; the flowers are double, of rosy colouring, and large, and
appear during the summer and into the autumn. It is best in warm,
well-drained soil.

CAMELLIA.--Mr. Scrase-Dickins writes in the _Garden_, March 30, 1901, p.
227, as follows about these little-understood hardy shrubs: "The best
Camellias for planting out of doors in the open air are those which
bloom late and start late into growth, such, for instance, as _Chandleri
elegans_ or _Anemonæflora_; the varieties with broad roundish leaves
appear to grow in more robust fashion than those having narrow pointed
ones with a serrated edge, though the latter will make sometimes very
compact bushes. It is possible that the sorts with dark-red flowers are
hardier than those with pink. The old double white seems to stand the
cold well enough, but it hides its flowers rather too much among the
foliage to make any effective display of them, though in this way they
are often secured from frost or bad weather and made serviceable for
cutting. To train against a trellis or wall _Doncklaarii_ is very good,
and next to _reticulata_ one of the most beautiful when well grown,
blooming so freely.

"Camellias appear to grow in almost any aspect, but are naturally sun
lovers; and though preferring peat, they will do in most other soils,
provided that there is no lime present. The points of the young roots
are very sensitive to drought, so should be protected until well
established, by light mulching or a surrounding growth, from the risk of
being withered up by a fierce sun striking the ground in which they are
starting. Unlike many other shrubs, they seem to have the advantage of
being exempt from the destructive attention of rabbits; perhaps when
snow is on the ground they might be barked, but I do not remember to
have noticed it. Apart from the question of varieties, it may be well to
draw attention to the fact that only strong healthy plants should be
turned out, for sickly specimens from a conservatory or greenhouse are
very slow indeed to make a start, and will remain sometimes for an
astonishing number of years in almost the same pitiable state."

CEANOTHUS.--Beautiful wall shrubs. They cannot be regarded as quite
hardy, but _C. azureus_ in a garden near London has mounted almost to
the chimney stacks; a surface of foliage, and in the appointed season
pale-blue flower clusters. The soil is light and the aspect due south;
and in cold, sunless places the Ceanothuses, it is well to remember,
utterly fail. A warm soil and sunny place suit the shrubs well. Gloire
de Versailles, Lucie Simon, and _pallidus_ are amongst the best of the
others. Of other species, _C. veitchianus_, deep blue, is very
beautiful; and _C. dentatus_ and _C. papillosus_ are also noteworthy.

CHIMONANTHUS FRAGRANS (Winter-sweet).--The variety _grandiflorus_ has
larger flowers and of a clearer shade of citron yellow than those of the
type, and though the plant is bare of leaf the blossoms make a brave
show, and may be descried against a well-toned brick wall from some
little distance. It is just as well to bear in mind that this is one of
the shrubs which bloom on the young wood, and any pruning or cutting out
of useless branches that may be necessary should be done in early spring
when the flowers are over, for if it be delayed there will be no
flowers next year. It may be raised from seed, but seedlings vary
greatly.

CHOISYA TERNATA (Mexican Orange Flower).--Very vigorous, shrubby,
glossy, green-leaved plant; rather tender, but quite happy in northern
gardens if not very exposed. Its clusters of flowers are very sweet and
white.

CLEMATIS (see p. 303).

COTONEASTER (see p. 80).

DIERVILLA.--May be grown against fences and even walls, but are better
against the former. I saw a fence covered with the crimson-flowered Eva
Rathke in a London garden, and flowered abundantly every year.

ECCREMOCARPUS SCABER.--Climber for wall, arch, or pergola, with reddish
flowers. Protect the roots by coating the soil above them with ashes or
some protective material.

EDWARDSIA (SOPHORA) TETRAPTERA.--This is called the New Zealand
Laburnum. A tree in its own country, but a shrubby wall plant here.
_Grandiflora_ is the best variety.

ESCALLONIA (see p. 385).

FUCHSIA.--The hardy Fuchsias are almost unknown, though amongst the most
beautiful of hardy shrubs. My favourite is _F. Riccartoni_, but this
often makes a good hedge. Very charming also are _F. coccinea_, _F.
corymbiflora_, _F. globosa_, _F. macrostemma_, _F. microphylla_, _F.
splendens_, and _F. thymifolia_.

HABLITZIA TAMNOIDES.--Better, perhaps, for arch, pergola, or tree stump
than a wall, but in some cases it may be placed there. It is a vigorous
climber, with misty masses of greenish flowers in summer and autumn. Not
often seen.

HEDERA (Ivy).--The Common Ivy when growing in an exposed position will
often acquire a rich bronzy hue during winter, but in this respect
individual plants vary a good deal, the smaller-leaved forms being as a
rule the richest in colour.

The most marked in this respect, and one that from its neat,
prettily-lobed leaves is well suited for use in making up button-holes,
sprays, &c., is the variety _atropurpurea_, whose distinctive character
is far more marked in winter than in summer. _Hedera Helix minima_ must
not be confounded with _H. H. conglomerata_, though at a certain stage
of growth there is some similarity. A three-year-old specimen differs
from the freer _conglomerata_ form in that it grows more flat both as
regards the twigs and the leaves on the twigs. It has more shining
foliage of a deeper and more sombre green, with pleasing clouded tints,
and further, as the name would suggest, it is a smaller plant in all its
parts. It is a beautiful creeper for positions on the rock garden, and
is one of the best surface plants, as through it bulbs may spear their
growth and flowers without injury. _H. H. pedata_ and _H. H. gracilis_,
both charming varieties of the small-leaved Ivies, should be in every
collection.

The uses to which Ivy may be put are innumerable, and with the many
beautiful varieties that are now to be obtained their sphere of
usefulness has considerably extended. One of the most picturesque
methods of growing Ivy is to allow it to clamber over tree stumps placed
here and there in suitable parts of the garden. Ivy banks also are very
charming, and for carpeting the bare ground beneath the spreading
branches of large trees nothing could be more suitable. For the latter
purpose the shoots should be pegged down and kept in position so that
they may take root. Suitable varieties for this purpose are _H.
dentata_, _H. rægneriana_, _rhombea_, _obovata_, _himalaica_, _pedata_,
_palmata_, _lobata_, &c.; but the best of all is an Ivy called Emerald
green.

[Illustration: _CAMELLIA, LEAF AND FRUIT (outdoors Cheshire)._]

INDIGOFERA GERARDIANA.--During the late summer and early autumn this
leguminiferous shrub is one of the most attractive of those that are
then in flower. Its finely divided pinnate leaves are of a rich deep
green, and almost fern-like in grace and luxuriance. It is, indeed,
worth growing for their sake alone. About the end of June it commences
to flower, produces its flower-spikes in the leaf-axils, and continues
to do so until the middle of September. The flowers are pea-shaped, and
borne on spikes 4 to 5 inches long. The colour is a bright rosy purple.
The species is a native of the Himalaya, and its stems do not survive
winters of even moderate severity. The root-stock is, however, perfectly
hardy, and it sends up a thicket of young growths every spring 2 to 4
feet long, which flower the same summer. It is not suited for growing in
large masses by itself, because it starts rather slowly, and the season
is advanced before the space the plants occupy becomes furnished. But it
is very suitable for the herbaceous border, or, still better, as an
undergrowth beneath groups of taller, thinly-planted shrubs. It is happy
also against a wall. Also known as _I. floribunda_.

JASMINUM.--The White Jasmine (_J. officinale_) is too well known to
describe. It is one of the best of the cheaper wall climbers. _Affine_
is the best variety; it has larger flowers. _J. humile_ (_revolutum_),
although an Indian species, will succeed against a wall; it has yellow
flowers and is evergreen. _J. fruticans_, another bushy species, may
also be grown; its flowers are yellow, and succeeded by an abundance of
round black berries which are very distinct and pleasing in winter. Of
course, the beautiful, fragrant, yellow-flowered _J. nudiflorum_ will
not be omitted. The new _J. primulinum_ has large yellow flowers in
spring. Wants a wall.

KERRIA JAPONICA.--Sometimes grown against a wall, but an excellent bush
for grouping, except in very cold and exposed gardens. The flowers are
yellow and produced abundantly. It should be more grown. The double
variety, _K. j. flore-pleno_, is frequently seen against cottage walls,
and making a cloud of yellow from the double rosette-like flowers in
early summer. The major form of this is the best.

[Illustration: _DUTCH HONEYSUCKLE ON WALL._]

LONICERA (Honeysuckle).--This is too well known to describe. The
Honeysuckle of the hedgerow is as familiar as the Poppy of the
cornfield. The common native Honeysuckle is _Lonicera Periclymenum_, the
best variety of which is _serotina_, or late Dutch; it flowers into the
autumn, and is of redder colouring. _Belgica_ is the Dutch Honeysuckle
and is of strong growth. _L. Caprifolium_ is not a true native, but has
become naturalised. _Major_ is a distinct variety. Then there are the
evergreen Trumpet Honeysuckles (_L. sempervirens_ and varieties, _minor_
being the best known; the flowers are scarlet and yellow).
_Plantierensis_ is a good hybrid with larger flowers. The Trumpet
Honeysuckles are not so robust and free as the late Dutch, for example.
The well-known variegated Japan Honeysuckle, _L. japonica
aureo-reticulata_, should not be planted much; its small, green,
yellow-netted leaves are pretty, but one quickly tires of their
colouring. _L. etrusca_, orange yellow, and _L. flava_, which must have
a warm place, may also be mentioned. Certain species are quite bushy in
growth. _L. tomentella_ has small pink flowers in July. _L.
fragrantissima_ blooms in winter and is a delightful wall Honeysuckle;
its small white flowers are very fragrant. _L. Standishii_ is also sweet
scented. A plant or two of either kind near the windows is very pleasant
on sunny winter days. The Honeysuckles are charming, and should be in
every garden--at least one or other of them.

MAGNOLIA.--_M. grandiflora_ (evergreen) is generally grown against a
wall. The large, glossy, green leaves and big, creamy, fragrant flowers
are very handsome. _M. conspicua_ (deciduous) I have also seen very
beautiful against a wall, a mass of white in late spring. The flowers in
this position are less likely to get damaged by frost and rain. Its
varieties may be used in the same way, but the type is the best.

OLEARIA (see p. 405).

PASSIFLORA CÆRULEA.--Few climbing plants are more fascinating than the
blue Passion Flower. It is, with its bluish flowers and orange,
egg-shaped fruit, most happy against a warm wall, and is not the
hardiest of climbers. The white variety, Constance Elliot, should be
grown also.

PIPTANTHUS NEPALENSIS (Nepaul Laburnum).--This is a shrubby wall plant,
and not a very important one. Its yellow flowers remind one of those of
the Laburnum, and are borne in clusters.

[Illustration: _POLYGONUM BALDSCHUANICUM OVER FIR._]

POLYGONUM BALDSCHUANICUM.--A beautiful shrubby climber, with clouds of
white, pink-tinted flowers in summer and autumn. An illustration shows
it clambering into a Fir tree near the rock garden at Kew. I have seen
many poor forms in gardens, seedlings, and therefore to keep the true
type, it must be increased by cuttings. If frost cuts the stems down in
winter, new growths spring up in the following year. Its graceful flower
masses are useful in the house. _P. molle_ is not unlike it.

PRUNUS TRILOBA is an excellent wall shrub (see illustration).

[Illustration: _PRUNUS TRILOBA AGAINST SUNNY WALL AT KEW._]

PUNICA (Pomegranate).--Both single and double.

PYRUS.--The Pyruses are described elsewhere in this book. _P. (Cydonia)
japonica_ and its many beautiful varieties, and _P. Maulei_ are,
however, more frequently grown against walls than any other members of
the same family. _Prunus triloba_ is an excellent wall shrub.

RAPHIOLEPIS OVATA.--A very handsome plant.

ROSA (Rose) (see p. 342).

RUBUS (see p. 450).

SMILAX.--This group is not common in gardens, but is interesting. They
are a change from the repetition of a few common things. _S.
rotundifolia_ is a very handsome large-leaved Smilax with shiny foliage,
now and then met with as _S. laurifolia_ or _S. latifolia_, from which,
however, according to Mr. R. Irwin Lynch, of Cambridge, it is distinct.
All the kinds of hardy Smilax form handsome leafy creepers for walls,
but in our climate they rarely produce the rich clusters of red berries
that often render them so attractive abroad.

SOLANUM.--_S. jasminoides_ is the most popular flowering climber of the
south-west, producing its white bloom-clusters for many months in
succession. It is classed as deciduous in botanical dictionaries, but is
rarely bare of leaves, except after severe frosts in the early months of
the year. _S. crispum_ and _S. Wendlandi_ will also succeed in mild
counties; the latter has very large bluish flowers.

STAUNTONIA LATIFOLIA (syn. _Holboellia latifolia_).--This plant bears
clusters of small greenish-white, highly-fragrant flowers in March, and
often perfects seed-pods in the autumn. It is a rapid grower, and its
leathery leaves are rarely affected by frost.

STUARTIA PSEUDO-CAMELLIA.--A rare and very beautiful flowering shrub now
seldom seen in even the best of gardens. It is a native of Japan, the
flowers being ivory white and perfectly cup-shaped, somewhat like a
single White Camellia. _S. pentagyna_ comes from North America, as also
_S. virginica_, but the first-named is the finest and is worth a good
deal of trouble to grow well. Planted in loam and peat and sand at the
foot of a sunny and sheltered wall, the flowering shoots may be
preserved intact during the winter. Perfect drainage is absolutely
essential for the first-named.

TRICUSPIDARIA HEXAPETALA.--A very distinct and beautiful evergreen
shrub, perhaps better known as _Crinodendron Hookeri_. It is a native of
Chili, and grows 5 or 6 feet high, its stiff branches set with dark,
shiny ovate leaves. The flowers are nearly globular, very fleshy, and
rich crimson-red or cherry colour. In both co. Wicklow, at Mount Usher,
and at Salerno, co. Dublin, this rare shrub is very luxuriant and
beautiful. It grows well in deep, rich, moist loam or in peaty soils,
and propagates readily by layers laid down under stones.

VIBURNUM.--Some of the Viburnums are handsome against walls, such as _V.
macrocephalum_ and the Chinese _V. plicatum_.

VITIS (Vine).--The Vines are the most graceful and beautiful of all
climbers, and many of them are of glorious colour in autumn. The
Virginian Creepers (_Ampelopsis_) are now grouped with the Vines. Of the
American Vines, _Vitis æstivalis_, _V. californica_, beautiful autumn
colour; _V. cordifolia_, the Northern Fox Grape (_V. Labrusca_),
Southern Fox Grape (_V. vulpina_). The Virginian Creeper (_V.
quinquefolia_) is, as is generally known, very showy in autumn. Of the
Asiatic Vines, _V. Coignetiæ_ is the most famous. It has very large
leaves, which turn to a glowing crimson in autumn. It is a noble
climber. _V. heterophylla humulifolia_ has beautiful fruit, each berry
about the size of a pea and turquoise blue; it likes a warm, sunny wall.
_V. (Ampelopsis) Veitchii_ is too well known to describe. _V. Romaneti_
and _V. vinifera_, the Common Grape Vine, also deserve notice. Of the
last-mentioned there are many beautiful varieties, such as _Purpurea_,
Miller's Burgundy, Teinturier, with claret-coloured foliage, and the
Parsley-leaved Vine. _V. Thunbergi_ has very fine leaves, which turn
crimson in autumn. The Vines should be seen in greater variety, and
Messrs. Veitch's recent beautiful novelties planted too.

[Illustration: _OLD WISTARIA AT HAMPTON COURT._]

WISTARIA.--Wistaria time is a pleasant season of the year. A few noble
examples may be seen in the suburbs of London, especially at Kew and
Hampton Court, where the trees must be a great age, while quite a fine
plant is in the Royal Gardens, Kew, also. What may be achieved with this
plant if some attention to its needs were forthcoming is not clear, for
most of the Wistarias we see from time to time shift for themselves, and
by the position they occupy must have large numbers of their roots in
dusty, dry soil. In former days it was always the custom to plant this
fine climber at the base of the dwelling-house wall, but now, with a
fuller knowledge of its robust growth, its widely-extending branches,
and equally its wide-rooting capacity, other positions may with
advantage be secured for it. One example may be seen at Kew, where a
fine plant covers a huge cage-like structure. Another good way would be
to plant it to run over pergolas, and with Clematis to succeed the
Wistaria, the effect would be distinctly good. _W. sinensis_, the
mauve-flowered species, is the one usually planted. The variety _alba_
is less robust, and does not flower so freely; it wants a warm place.
The double variety is very beautiful when in perfection, but our
experience is that it never flowers freely, and the raceme is often
poor. _W. multijuga_ has very long racemes, and is the Wistaria which
gives so much beauty to the gardens in Japan. It is always a pleasure in
Wistaria time to visit the Royal Gardens, Kew, and see the exquisitely
coloured trails of flowers on this species; these trails measure between
2 and 3 feet in length. Rosea is a rose-coloured variety.

CHAPTER XXXVI

FLOWERING AND OTHER HEDGES


Of the more or less known 3000 species and varieties of trees and shrubs
hardy in this country, only a small proportion are suitable for making
good hedges. Every garden of any size has a hedge or two of untidy look
through inattention at the proper time. A hedge must be kept in proper
order, not a difficult business when clipping is done annually, when to
do so depending upon the plants used.

Hedges may be of two kinds--the neat trimmed hedge, which serves as an
outside line to a garden, and also as a screen or wind-break to small or
tender plants growing near it; and the straggling rough hedge, varying
from 10 to 20 feet in width, more properly a wide bank made up of all
sorts of plants, rambling Roses, ornamental Vines, and other things
which usually serve to brighten some spot where colour is desirable, or
to shut out an undesirable view. The best plants comprise both
evergreens and deciduous, but only one thing should be used, as mixed
hedges are rarely a success, and of mingled evergreen and deciduous
plants are generally quite a failure. It is right to mention, however,
that if a mixed hedge is planted the best results are from White Thorn,
Holly, and Common Beech. The best evergreen plants in their order of
merit are Holly, Yew, Arbor-vitæ (_Thuya occidentalis_), _Thuya
gigantea_ or _Lobbi_, Common Box, _Cupressus lawsoniana_, _C.
nootkatensis_ (_Thujopsis borealis_), Privet (_Ligustrum_), Common
Laurel, Portugal Laurel Pyramid Laurel (_Prunus lusitanica myrtifolia_),
_Berberis Darwinii_, and _Osmanthus ilicifolius_.

HOLLY.--The Common Holly makes one of the best evergreen hedges. Its
growth, though somewhat slow, is regular, and it does not mind the
shears, but it is costly to use to any extent. It does not move readily,
so that for the first year or two there will probably be a few gaps to
fill up, but when the hedge is once established it is there practically
for ever, and with proper attention will never become rough or
unsightly. Before planting the site should be marked out, and the ground
trenched 3 feet wide and deep, breaking the subsoil with a fork, and
working some well-decayed manure about half-way down. This will tend to
draw the roots down, and keep them from running out on either side to
the injury of neighbouring plants. Plants should be obtained in the
early autumn, as soon as it is safe to move them, and planted at once
before the ground gets cool. If this be done they will make fresh roots
and get established before winter. Some prefer to move Hollies in May,
but much depends on whether artificial watering can be done. If it can,
May is quite as good a time as September or October; if not, then choose
the autumn.

The size of the plants used depends upon taste and the depth of the
pocket, but good plants, 1½ to 2 feet high, with a leading shoot or two
on each, placed from 12 to 16 inches apart, can be recommended, as they
move readily at that size, and are not so costly as larger plants. Holly
hedges should be clipped in late August or early September, when they
will make a short growth before winter, and keep in good condition
without further attention until the following autumn. The height of the
hedge is entirely a matter for the owner to decide, one 30 or 40 feet
high, properly feathered to the ground, being quite possible, as we know
from some already in existence. When grown to this height, however, the
top should be cut to a point to throw off snow. The flatness of the
hedge can be broken by allowing a few leading shoots, 20 or 30 feet
apart, to run up, budding them in August with some of the variegated
varieties. Gold Queen, Waterer's Gold, Silver Queen, and _Argentea
variegata_ are good sorts to use for this.

When a Holly hedge has been neglected for some years cut it back to the
old wood in March or April, and fork in a liberal dressing of manure
around it. It may not make much growth the first year, but will
practically re-establish itself the second.

YEW.--The Common Yew is hard to kill, and easy to prune into various
shapes, as topiary work suggests. Yew is generally used for the inside
of a garden, such as terraces and hedges near the house. It should be
treated in the same way as the Holly, with the important exception of
being clipped in May, as the Yew makes most of its growth in the early
part of the year. In buying Yews, choose rather stunted-looking plants
in preference to those of fresher look and freer growth. The former have
been moved within the last year or two, the latter have stood for three
or four, and become coarse rooted, suffering, therefore, after removal.

ARBOR-VITÆ.--For a hedge this and _Thuya gigantea_ can be placed
together. The common Arbor-Vitæ is sometimes not liked because it gets
brown in winter, but this colouring is not so pronounced in _Thuya
gigantea_. In preparing the ground little or no manure need be trenched
in, but a dressing of spent manure may be added with advantage. The soil
should be as good as possible, but not too heavy. They may be clipped at
any season, and for the first two or three years twice annually will not
be too often. It is wise to cut off from six inches to one foot of the
leaders every year, otherwise the plants attain a great height without
breadth. If a hedge of these conifers is allowed to become rough and
ragged, it is almost impossible to restore it, as it will not, except in
special cases, break from the older wood.

BOX.--The dwarf edging so largely used for borders and paths needs no
description, but the Common Box is not so largely used because it gets
yellow, the result of sheer starvation, the Box being a gross feeder,
requiring plenty of feeding at all times. It should have a dressing of
manure annually, or at least biennially, to keep it in good health and
colour. It should be clipped in the spring, April or May being the best
months, and a top-dressing about the same time will be very beneficial
to it. Box is a good shrub for an inside hedge, but should never become
overgrown, as, in addition to the hard cutting necessary to bring it
into shape, it is a terrible plant to cut, even the small wood being
very hard and tough.

LAWSON CYPRESS.--_Cupressus lawsoniana_ and _C. nootkatensis_ (_Thujopis
borealis_) can be treated together, as, in addition to their natural
relationship, both require the same treatment as a hedge. Neither makes
a good flat-topped hedge of the ordinary kind, as the growth is
distinctly pyramidal, and unless kept to a point is apt to get injured
by snow. They should be cut to a point, and a hedge 12 to 20 feet high
of this shape is very handsome and effective in a garden, as well as
forming a first-rate screen. They can be trimmed at any time preferably
in the spring or early summer, care being taken not to cut the base too
hard, and the leading shoots top annually. In planting no manure need be
used, provided the ground is good, and it is not required later on
unless the hedge shows signs of starvation, when a good top dressing may
be given with advantage. Plants 2 or 3 feet in height, placed about 18
inches apart, are a good size to use, as they move readily and are not
expensive.

PRIVET.--The oval-leaved Privet (_Ligustrum ovalifolium_) is a native of
Japan, and makes a fairly good hedge about 5 or 6 feet high. It grows
readily, and moves without any trouble at almost any time. It can be
bought cheaply. The ground should be well treated in the first place;
afterwards it will require little attention in the way of feeding. It
can be clipped at almost any time, but for the first year or two should
be cut hard back before growth begins in the spring. Neglect of this
leads to a hedge that is leafy at the top but bare at the bottom. In
this note the use of Privet is not wholly condemned, but it must be
understood its use is not recommended. There is no doubt whatever that
for town gardens the Privet is of the greatest service, enduring smoke
and fog with impunity. It is vigorous, and soon becomes established in
the most dreary gardens.

LAURELS.--Any of the various forms of the Common and Portugal Laurels
with the types are suitable for what may be called second-rate hedges,
the best being the Pyramid Portugal, which is a smaller-leaved and more
upright-growing kind than any of the others. With the exception of the
last-named, all the Laurels make hedges rather wide for their height,
and all require much attention to keep them in proper shape. All should
be clipped in June, after the first growth is made; they will then make
another short growth, which will keep the hedge in good condition until
the following year. The Pyramid Portugal has leaves about half the size
of those of the type and quickly makes a hedge. It is rather more
expensive than the commoner Laurels, but it moves well, and does not
become bare at the bottom.

OSMANTHUS ILICIFOLIUS.--This plant has not been much used for hedges,
but it makes a very good one if carefully looked after during the
first year or two. It somewhat resembles the Common Holly, and requires
much the same treatment. It is not very expensive to buy, and the hedge
should be kept to a height of 3 or 4 feet.


Deciduous Hedges

Many deciduous plants can be used for hedges, but a good selection
comprises Beech, Hornbeam, Quick, Myrobalan Plum, and Sweetbriar. The
first two require practically the same treatment, the most important
part of which is to procure good two or three years old transplanted
plants, and to treat them liberally at first. Beyond an annual trimming
they will not require any further attention, except to tie or peg down a
branch or two where gaps may occur. A well known gardener, writing in
the _Garden_, says: "We often find the Holly and the Yew largely used in
gardens as hedges, but they are not quite so good under all conditions
as the Beech or Hornbeam. The Beech is one of our many hardy trees both
for screens and hedges. The Copper Beech is seldom used for this
purpose, but this is a mistake. We have a fence of the Copper Beech,
dividing the kitchen garden from the pleasure grounds, 138 yards long,
18 feet high, and from 4 feet to 5 feet through. It forms a perfect wall
on either side, and in spring is one of the most interesting features of
the place. It would be useless planting the Copper Beech on a wet or
heavy soil--a light soil suits it best. The hedge is now in perfect
health, and all that is necessary is an annual clipping about the end of
August, before the wood gets hard."

[Illustration: _GREAT BEECH HEDGE AT MICKLEOUR, N.B._]

Quick and the Myrobalan Plum should be planted in double rows to form a
hedge, and be cut back hard at the time of planting to form a bottom to
the hedge, which would otherwise become leggy and bare at the base. If
they should happen to get into this state most of the growth should be
cut away, and the main branches tied or pegged down in the direction of
the hedge. In a year or two it will be practically as good as ever.

For a dividing line between the flower and kitchen gardens, or for some
spot where too much formality is not required, the Common Sweetbriar
makes an excellent hedge, although it requires much attention for the
first few years. If planted without support, such as a wooden railing,
it should be kept tied or pegged down almost to the ground for the first
two or three years, using practically every growth that is made by the
plants. By this means a good foundation is laid for the hedge, which
will, when made, merely require an annual trimming. We plant Sweetbriars
everywhere. Its leaves in the early morning, or after a warm summer
rain, saturate the air with their fragrance.


Hedges of Flowering Shrubs

It often happens that some kind of hedge is wanted in a garden, either
as a screen to hide vegetable ground, or as a wind-break, or some kind
of partition. When this is the case, it is a good plan to plant hardy
flowering shrubs about 4 feet apart, and so to train and trim them that
they grow into a compact hedge, and yet have enough lateral play to
allow them to flower. Two years ago we privately advised some friends
who were planting new gardens where such dividing hedges were wanted,
and the hedges are already coming into use and beauty.

Such a hedge is not only ornamental, but it yields endless material for
cutting. It should be allowed to grow quite 4 feet thick, and is best
formed with a backbone of stiff woody shrubs, such as Guelder Roses,
_Ribes_, and Lilac, while between the stiffer shrubs might be some that
are weaker, such as _Kerria_, _Rhodotypus_, and _Leycesteria_. Plants of
rank rambling growth, such as free Roses and double-flowered Brambles,
_Aristolochia_, _Wistaria_, Virginia Creeper, and the rambling
Honeysuckles, are not in place in such a hedge; they are more suitable
for rough hedge banks, walls, or for arbour and pergola; the flower
hedge wants true shrubs. The bush Honeysuckles, such as _Lonicera
fragrantissima_ and _L. tatarica_, are just right, or any woody, twiggy
bushes of moderate growth, or such as are amenable to pruning and
thinning, such as _Deutzia_ and Snowberry, shrubs that so often get
overgrown in a shrubbery. In the hedge these would do well, as they
could easily be watched and thinned; also many true shrubs that flower
all the better for reasonable pruning.

[Illustration: _HEDGE OF MAIDEN'S BLUSH ROSE (6 feet to 7 feet high)._]

Any one would be surprised to see what a quantity of useful flowers such
a hedge would yield, while, if there is another of foliage for winter
use, it will be invaluable to the indoor decorator. We have just planted
a hedge for this use, all of golden variegated or yellow-leaved shrubs,
those chosen being the Scotch Gold Holly, Golden Euonymus, Golden
Privet, yellow variegated Box, and Golden Tree Ivy, all shrubs of the
utmost value for winter cuttings. Though they are barely 2 feet high as
yet, the slightly varied golden hedge is already a pleasant, cheering
sight in the quickly-shortening November days.

Other flower hedges are also delightful possessions. Hedges of China
Rose, of Lavender, of Sweetbriar, of old garden Roses, or of climbing or
rambling Roses trained down, of Honeysuckles, of Jasmine; some of these
are occasionally seen, but of a good selection of true shrubs hedges are
rarely if ever made.

Any of the shrubs recommended for the mixed flowering hedge could, of
course, be used alone; and excellent it would be to have a hedge of
Guelder Rose or flowering Currant or Japan Quince, and how much more
interesting than the usual hedge of Quick or Privet or Holly. Both sides
of the flower hedge should be easily accessible, not necessarily by a
hard path, but by a space just wide enough to go along comfortably. An
additional advantage well worth considering would be that, supposing the
direction of the hedge to be east and west, the south side would flower
in advance of the north, and so prolong the supply of bloom.




CHAPTER XXXVII

PLEACHED OR GREEN ALLEYS


In the old days the pleached alley was as familiar in English gardens as
the pergola of the present age. Both are interesting, and both provide
grateful shadowed walks in the heat of summer. The trees most generally
used in the fashioning of pleached alleys were the Hornbeam and Lime,
both native of this country, but green alleys have been made of Yew, of
_Cotoneaster buxifolia_, of Holly, and other evergreens. There are
flowering Cherries of weeping habit that would suit well for such
treatment, and several other small trees of pendulous growth, such as
Laburnum, Weeping Ash, and the large-leaved Weeping Elm. There is an
important green alley at West Dean, near Chichester, of Laburnum only.

[Illustration: _A NUT WALK._]

The green alley differs from the pergola in that the pergola has solid
and permanent supports, its original purpose, in addition to the giving
of shade, being to support vines. The green alley, being made of stiffer
and more woody growths, only needs a temporary framework to which to
train the trees till they have filled the space and formed the shape.
Hornbeam was the tree most used in former ages, and for a simple green
alley nothing is better. Beech is also good. Several other of the
smaller trees of weeping growth should be more used for this and the
allied uses of training for arbours and other shelter-places in the
garden.

The common Plane is much used on the continent for green shelters; the
trees are pollarded at about eight feet high, and the vigorous young
growths trained down horizontally to a slight framework.

It would be interesting to make a green alley with two or perhaps three
kinds of plants whose leaf form was of the same structure. For instance,
a groundwork of Weeping Ash could soon be trained into shape, and
Wistaria would be best to grow all over and through it. The more stiff
and woody Ash would supply the eventual solid framework, as by the time
the Wistaria was making strong growth (for it is very slow to make a
beginning) the whole would be well in shape, and might dispense with the
framing of "carpenters' work" that is necessary for its first shaping.
It would be best to plant the Ash zigzag across the path so that the
main of the head of each tree might be trained across the path and down
to the ground on the opposite side, when it would occupy the space
between the two opposite trees.

It is important to further maintain the distinction between green alley
and pergola by using in the green alley only things of a permanent and
woody character; no Roses or Clematis, or any other plants of which
portions are apt to die or wear out. These are proper to the pergola,
whose permanent substructure makes it easier to cut away and renew those
of its coverings, whether structural or growing, that are liable to
partial decay.

A great many delightful things may be done with these green alleys and
green shelters. Much interest is already aroused in the pergola, and
when thinking of this it is well to consider these other ways of adding
to the comfort and charm of our gardens. One thing, however, should be
carefully considered. It should be remembered that where a path is made
more important by passing under trained green growths it should have
some definite reason for being so accentuated, certainly at one and
desirably at both ends. It often occurs that in laying out ground the
owner wishes to have a pergola, as it were, in the air, and when there
is nothing to justify its presence. It should not be put at haphazard
over any part of the garden walk. If of any length, it should distinctly
lead from somewhere to somewhere of importance in the garden design, and
should, at least at one end, finish in some distinct full-stop, such as
a well-designed summer-house or tea-house.

Another important matter is that a pergola or green alley, in the usual
sense, should never wind or go uphill. It is not intended by this that
shading coverings cannot be used in such places, but that they would
want especial design, and it is altogether a matter of doubt if these
could not be much better treated in other ways.

The circumstances of different gardens are so infinitely various that it
is impossible to lay down hard rules; only general rules can be given
and exceptional circumstances dealt with by exceptional treatment.

Green alleys require some attention. In winter the oldest of the wood
must be cut out to make room for the young growth, and when this is
lengthening vigorously it must be carefully laid in.

If the alley has an iron framework, which is necessary when such strong
growing things as Wistaria are used, this may be clothed during the
first few years, until the Wistaria is growing strongly, with annual
climbers such as _Cobæa scandens_, _lophospermum_, _Mina lobata_, and
even varieties of the large-flowered Clematis, which must be removed
when the Wistaria covers the alley.

[Illustration: _OLD APPLE WALK (Helmingham Hall)._]

Very charming alleys are sometimes formed of fruit trees--Pear, Apple,
Cherry, and Plum making delightful spring pictures, and almost as much
so when in fruit in autumn. Where fruit and flower are desired every
shoot must be exposed to sun and air. When densely shaded by other
growths the wood does not ripen, and therefore flowers badly, if at
all.




CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE GARDEN ORCHARD


One's enjoyment of the garden would be greatly increased if the orchard,
which is so often thrust away into a remote corner, were brought into
direct communication with it. How easily the trimmer lawn spaces might
lead through groups of flowering shrubs to the rather rougher grassy
orchard. How naturally the garden Roses and masses of free-growing
Cluster Roses would lead to their near relations, the Pears and Apples
and other fruiting trees of the great Rose order.

There is no need to make a definite break between the two; it is all the
better not to know where the garden ends and the orchard begins. Towards
the edge of the mown lawn there may already be trees of the Red Siberian
Crab and the handsome Crab John Downie, and the pretty little Fairy
Apple; while the nearer orchard trees may well be wreathed with some of
the free Cluster Roses, such as Bennett's Seedling or Dundee Rambler.

[Illustration: _OLD MULBERRY AT SYON, MIDDLESEX._]

If the orchard is of some extent its standard trees of Pear, Apple,
Cherry, and Plum may be varied by three or four bush trees, or by some
of the beautiful fruit trees of lower growth, such as Medlars and
Quinces. There may also be breaks of cut-leaved Blackberry and a
thicket of Crabs or Filberts, and on some one side, or perhaps more, a
shady Nut alley. There is no need to be always moving the garden
orchard. One wide, easy, grassy way might well be kept closely shorn,
but much of the middle and side spaces had better not be cut until
hay-time, for many would be the bulbs planted under the turf, great
drifts of Daffodils and Spanish Scillas, and Fritillaries for the larger
effects, and Colchicums and Saffron Crocus for the later months. If the
grass were mown again in September, just before the Colchicums appear,
it would allow of easy access to the fruit trees in the time of their
harvest, and in those interesting weeks immediately before the Apples
ripen.

[Illustration: _OLD MEDLAR TREE ON EDGE OF GARDEN ORCHARD._]

It must not be forgotten that the best use of many fruit-bearing trees
is not restricted to the kitchen garden only, for many of them are
beautiful things in the most dressed ground. Few small trees are more
graceful in habit than the old English Quince that bears the smooth,
roundish fruits. It is not only a pleasant object in leaf and flower in
early summer, and in autumn glory of golden fruit, but even when bare of
leaves in winter a fully matured tree is strikingly beautiful, and in
boggy ground where no other tree would thrive it is just at its happiest
and is most fruitful. Then many Apples are extremely ornamental, and
there is a whole range of Crabs; Siberian, Chinese, and home-raised
hybrids that are delightful things both in flower and in fruit. _Pyrus
Maulei_, vieing in beauty of bloom with its near neighbours, the
Japanese Quinces, quite outdoes them in glory and bounty of fruit, which
in October is one of the most brilliant things in the garden. There are
no better garden ornaments for foliage than Figs and Vines, and though
the needful pruning of a Vine for fruit takes off somewhat of its
pictorial value, which depends in some measure on the wide-flung,
luscious summer growth and groping tendril, yet in any shape the Grape
Vine is a thing of beauty. Some of its garden kinds also show how, in
distinct departures in colour and shape of leaf, it is always beautiful;
for the Parsley-leaved Vine, with its dainty and deeply-cut foliage, is
a suitable accompaniment to the most refined architecture; while the
red-purple leaf of the Claret Vine and its close clusters of blue fruit
are richly ornamental in the autumn garden. A Medlar tree, with its
large white bloom and handsome leaves, is desirable, and several of the
Services are ornamental small trees. Every one knows the lovely pink
bloom of the Almond in April, but few may have tried something that is
not an experiment but a certainty--namely, the successful culture of the
hardier Peaches, near relatives to the Almond, as standards in the south
of England. A Peach of American origin, the Early Alexander, bears full
or fair crops every year. The only danger is from leaf blister from
sudden cold in May, but if its position is sheltered, or if it can be
afforded the protection of a net, it will suffer but little, and
perfectly ripened peaches, red all round, may be had at the end of July.
The beauty of Cherry blossom is so well known that it needs no
extolling; and any great high wall looks the better at all seasons for a
well-trained old Pear.

A free planting of the cut-leaved Bramble is pleasant to see on the
outskirts of the garden, and is beautiful in leaf, in flower, and in
fruit.




CHAPTER XXXIX

THE WORTHY USE OF ROSES


For a full consideration of the Rose as a garden flower, one must look
to such a work as "Roses for English Gardens," but as the Rose is a
flowering shrub it cannot be omitted from the present volume.

In these days of horticultural prosperity and rapid progress, when there
would appear to be one or more specialists devoting themselves to every
worthy flower, we need scarcely say that the Rose has not been
forgotten. Indeed, within the memory of many who have watched its
culture for the last forty years, the rapid advance is nothing less than
astonishing. Our own veteran growers and some of the foreign firms seem
to have vied with each other in producing new forms in the Hybrid
Perpetuals and in the Teas, but it has been almost within the last
decade that growers have not only deepened the interest in the
cultivation of the Rose, but have immensely widened it by striking out
in new directions.

It is now many years since the late Henry Bennett raised such lovely
hybrids as Grace Darling and Mrs. John Laing, but the parents of these
were still among the well-known H.P.'s and Teas and Chinas. But of late
years hybridists have taken in hand some of the handsomer of the
species, and by working them with well-established favourites have
produced whole new ranges of fine Roses. Of these the most prominent
have been products of _R. multiflora_, _rugosa_, _rubiginosa_, and
_wichuraiana_. The striking success of many of these later hybrids is
encouraging in the highest degree, and the field for future work is so
immense that the imagination can hardly grasp the extent of the prospect
that these earlier successes seem to open out.

There are so many ways in which Roses may be beautiful. Even in the
varied form and habit possessed by the types some special kind of beauty
is shown and some special garden utility is foreshadowed. And then we
think of the future possibilities of the Rose garden! Already--we say it
with deliberation and a feeling of honest conviction--the Rose garden
has never been developed to anything like its utmost possible beauty.
The material already to hand even twenty years ago has never been
worthily used.

The Rose garden to be beautiful must be designed and planted and tended,
not with money and labour and cultural skill only, but with brains and
with love, and with all those best qualities of critical
appreciation--the specially-cultured knowledge of what is beautiful, and
why it is beautiful--besides the indispensable ability of the practical
cultivator.

There are in some places acres of Rose gardens, many of them only costly
expositions of how a Rose garden had best not be made. The beautiful
Rose garden, that shall be the living presentment of the poet's dream,
and shall satisfy the artist's eye, and rejoice the gardener's heart,
and give the restful happiness and kindle the reverent wonderment of
delight, in such ways as should be the fulfilment of its best purpose,
has yet to be made.

It matters not whether it is in the quite free garden where Roses shall
be in natural groups and great flowery masses and arching fountains, and
where those of rambling growth on its outskirts shall clamber into
half-distant surrounding trees and bushes, or whether it is in the
garden of ordered formality that befits a palatial building; there are
the Roses for all these places, and for all these and many other uses.
Indeed, for reducing the hard lines of the most formal gardens and for
showing them at their best, for such enjoyment as they may give by the
humanising of their rigid lines and the softening of their original
intention as a display of pomp and state and the least sympathetic kind
of greatness, the beneficent quality of age and accompanying over-growth
may be best shown by the wreathing and clambering cluster Roses, whose
graceful growth and tender bloom are displayed all the better for their
association with the hard lines and rough textures of masonry surfaces.


SOME BEAUTIFUL WILD ROSES

No family of hardy shrubs is more bewildering in the multiplicity and
intricacy of its nomenclature than Rosa. Although there are many species
now accepted by botanists, yet the pseudo-specific names may be counted
by hundreds. Fortunately for those interested in their cultivation, a
good many of these names refer to plants with very unimportant
distinctions (many of them, indeed, are minor forms of our native Dog
Rose), and the best of the wild species are mostly grown under the names
applied to them in the following notes.

Their cultivation is simple. They are like the Hybrid Perpetuals in
their love for a rich loamy soil--one inclining to a clayey rather than
to a sandy nature. Loving abundant sunlight, they are not happy in shady
spots. The commonest mistake in their cultivation is in pruning. The
notion that they have to be cut back like Hybrid Perpetuals and
such-like Roses has often resulted in the loss of a season's flowers,
besides destroying for the time the peculiar beauty of habit that many
species possess. The shoots, often long, sucker-like growths that push
from the base in summer, supply the flowers of the following year, and
until they have flowered should not be touched with a knife. Whatever
pruning is necessary--and it is, as a rule, a mere matter of thinning
out of old worn-out stems--is to give the young growths more air and
freedom. No shortening back is needed. It may always be remembered that
some of the most beautiful specimens of Wild Roses in existence,
especially those of rambling growth, have never been pruned at all. The
chief thing is always to retain the free, unfettered grace natural to
the plants. Pruning will help to do this, but it must be pruning of the
proper kind.

In the wilder parts of the garden the common Dog Rose (_R. canina_) and
its numerous varieties are worth a place; they flower well, and are
always beautiful in fruit. The same may be said of the Sweet Briar (_R.
rubiginosa_), the fragrance of whose young growths is always a delight,
whether in garden or hedgerow. _R. hibernica_, a British Rose, thought
to be a hybrid between the Scotch Rose and _R. canina_, comes in the
same category. It flowers earlier than the Dog Rose.

For the wild garden also there are several other Roses that may be
mentioned, such as _cinnamomea_, with rosy-red flowers and crimson
fruit; _nutkana_, _acicularis_, _pisocarpa_, and _californica_. Only
those are mentioned that from their greater beauty and distinctness
deserve a more detailed notice.

R. ALBA.--Although found wild in several parts of Europe, this, the
"Common White Rose" of Linnæus, is supposed to be a hybrid between _R.
gallica_ and the Dog Rose. It is always found in places which lead to
the belief that it is not truly indigenous, but an escape from
cultivated grounds. The typical plant has white flowers that are
considerably larger than those of the Dog Rose, and the petals have more
substance. There are now numerous double-flowered varieties in gardens,
some beautifully tinged with rose.

R. ALBERTI.--A native of Turkestan, where it was discovered by M. Albert
Regel not many years ago. This is one of the rarest species of Rosa in
cultivation. The flowers are bright yellow, the leaves small and much
divided.

R. ALPINA.--This is the species from which the Boursault Roses have been
derived. It is a native of the Alps and Pyrenees. The stems are 4 to 5
feet high, and have few or no spines except when young. The flowers are
rosy red; the fruits red, often pear-shaped, and covered with bristles,
which, when rubbed, have a turpentine-like odour.

R. ARVENSIS (or R. REPENS).--From this species the Ayrshire Roses have
been obtained. It is naturally a trailing or climbing plant, having long
thin shoots and white flowers. When trained over tree stumps or rough
stakes and ultimately allowed to grow at will, it forms tangled masses
which are very pretty. But the double forms--even the common variety,
_flore-pleno_--are to be preferred, being especially useful in semi-wild
spots. The type is wild in England, and frequently to be seen in hedges
and thickets.

R. CAROLINA.--For certain positions this is a useful Rose. It has erect
stems and forms dense thickets, spreading rapidly by means of the
numerous underground rhizomes it sends out in all directions. The
flowers are purplish-rose. A later-flowering variety known as
_nuttalliana_ is a stronger grower and has larger flowers. This will
flower up to September. _R. lucida_ and _R. nitida_ are, like _R.
carolina_, natives of North America, and are of similar habit, but they
are dwarfer and the leaves are more glossy. All these are apt to become
crowded with old stems, and, besides an occasional thinning out, are
much improved by dividing up every three or four years.

R. FERRUGINEA (R. RUBRIFOLIA).--This species, which comes from the
Pyrenees and Alps, is remarkable for the reddish-purple colour of its
leaves and young shoots. Groups of half-a-dozen or more plants give a
striking colour effect. The flowers are similar to the Dog Rose, but
red.

R. LÆVIGATA (R. SINICA).--Except in the south and south-west or in
similarly favoured localities, this is not really hardy, but where it
thrives it is a singularly beautiful Rose, perhaps unsurpassed among
single Roses in the size of its pure white flowers. It is known as the
Cherokee Rose, and is naturalised in some of the Southern United States.
A lovely hybrid between it and _R. indica_ has been raised and named
Anemone. Its flowers are soft rose.

R. LUTEA (Austrian Briar)--Of all the Wild Yellow Roses this is the most
beautiful. The yellow-flowered species do not, as a rule, thrive so well
as the others in gardens--one has only to mention such species as
_berberifolia_, _sulphurea_, _xanthina_ (or _Ecæ_) to recall that. But
_R. lutea_, in strong loam with plenty of lime added, generally thrives
well. The copper-coloured varieties are more difficult to deal with in
suburban districts. The flowers of the typical _R. lutea_ are of the
brightest rich yellow. When in good health it produces each year long
arching shoots, wreathed from end to end with blossom. This species
comes from the Orient.

R. MICROPHYLLA--This interesting species is closely allied to _R.
rugosa_, and is a native of China. It has a sturdy bushy habit, few
spines, and the curious habit of peeling its bark. Its foliage is very
handsome, the leaflets being small and numerous. The flowers are rose
coloured and very fragrant. The shrub is interesting for its fine
fruits, which are of large size, very spiny, and of a yellowish colour
when ripe. Although some other species surpass this in showiness, it is
one of the most distinct.

R. MOSCHATA (Musk Rose).--When seen at its best, few of the rambling
species are more beautiful than this. It is not, however, so hardy as
some, especially when young, in which state it makes long, succulent
shoots during summer and autumn, which are apt to be killed back in
winter. Old plants do not suffer in the same way, or not so severely.
Its flowers are borne in great clusters, and are notable for their pure
whiteness and conspicuous bunches of bright-yellow stamens. The best
plants often of this species are in shrubberies, where, no doubt, the
other shrubs afford it some protection. It is a native of the Orient and
India. The name "Musk Rose" refers to a perfume which may occasionally
be detected in its flowers after a shower, but is never very apparent.
_Nivea_ is a beautiful form.

[Illustration: _ROSA MULTIFLORA_]

R. MULTIFLORA.--This, the Polyantha Rose, the wild type of the group so
named and the progenitor of many graceful Roses, is a native of Japan
and China. It is a shrub 8 feet or more high, forming a dense thicket of
arching branches. Its flowers individually are small, but they come in
large dense clusters and so abundantly as to transform the shrub into a
mass of white. They are very fragrant. This is an admirable plant for
putting at the top of a wall or steep bank which it is desirable to
drape with vegetation. The Polyantha group of Roses can always be
distinguished by the stipules at the base of the leaf-stalk being
fringed.

R. OCHROLEUCA.--In stature, foliage, and mode of growth this is like the
Scotch Rose, but its flowers are of as bright and rich a yellow as those
of the Austrian Yellow (_R. lutea_). Where _R. lutea_ does not grow
well, this will be an excellent substitute. A native of Siberia.

R. POMIFERA (Apple Rose).--This is, perhaps, the most striking of Roses
in regard to its fruit. The hips are 1 to 1½ inches long, apple or
pear-shaped, of a fine bright red, and covered with bristles. It is a
species that requires generous conditions at the root to be seen at its
best. _R. mollis_ and _R. tomentosa_ belong to the same group, and have
also fine red fruits, but they are much smaller than those of _R.
pomifera_.

R. RUGOSA (Japanese Rose).--No plant has come to the front more rapidly
in recent years than this Rose. It was introduced from Japan in 1845,
but appears to have been neglected. It is one of the very hardiest of
Roses, as well as one of the sturdiest and most robust. The leaves are
very handsome, the leaflets being of a rich green and wrinkled. The
flowers in the wild type are rosy crimson, but there is also a white
variety, and seedlings give quite a variety of shades. It hybridises
freely with other species and garden varieties, and has in this way
enriched our gardens with many good hybrids, Mme. Georges Bruant and the
Coubert Double White among them. The fruits of _R. rugosa_ are
orange-shaped, scarlet red, and of large size--altogether very
ornamental.

[Illustration: _HYBRID ROSE UNA, A SHRUBBY GROUP ON GRASS._

(_Bed is 70 feet in circumference and contains 15 plants._)]

R. SERICEA.--For some reason this Rose has never obtained the
recognition it deserves. Perhaps its comparative rarity may account for
this. It is the earliest of all Roses to flower out of doors, its first
blossoms opening as a rule towards the latter end of May; the flowers
are creamy white. In the cooler days of May and early June it lasts
longer in bloom than many of the later flowering species do. It has one
very distinctive character, in the petals being nearly always four
(instead of the usual five) to each flower. Sometimes the bark of the
young shoots is a bright red. A native of North India.

R. SETIGERA.--Of the North American Roses none has proved more useful in
this country than the Prairie Rose. A rambler in habit, it is valuable
for its vigorous growth and late flowering. The flowers are large, deep
rose, and appear in July and August.

R. SPINOSISSIMA (R. PIMPINELLIFOLIA).--The Scotch Rose is one of the
earliest species to bloom; it is also one of the prettiest and most
distinct. The stems are dwarf and covered with bristles, the leaves
small, and the flower white and cup-shaped. There are several wild
varieties of it, the two most noteworthy being _altaica_ (or
_grandiflora_) and _hispida_. Both these grow 6 feet or more high, and
the flowers of both are larger than the typical Scotch Rose. Those of
_altaica_ are creamy white; those of _hispida_ a lovely cream yellow.
The garden varieties of this Rose are numerous--some double, some
single, and varying in colour from yellow to white and from pink to
purple. The type is found wild in several parts of Britain.

R. WEBBIANA.--Coming from some of the highest elevations on the Himalaya
at which shrubby vegetation exists, this species is the hardiest of the
Indian Roses. It has a thin, graceful habit, and its spiny stems are
blue white when young. This year it has been very pretty in the unusual
profusion of its bluish-tinted flowers, each of which are about 2 inches
across. The leaves are of a blue green, and are similar in size and
division to those of the Scotch Roses. But it is quite distinct from
them or any others, for which reason it is worth the notice of lovers of
these wild types.

R. WICHURAIANA.--It is not many years since this Japanese Rose was first
introduced, but it is now fairly well known. It is a perfectly prostrate
plant, and is remarkable for the shiny, varnished appearance of the
leaves. It is one of the latest species to come into bloom. The flowers
are pure white, and appear during July and August in clusters resting on
the carpet of glossy foliage. It makes an excellent covering for sunny
banks where the soil is good. Old tree stumps are also pretty when
covered with this Rose. It has already been hybridised, and among its
progeny are Pink Roamer, Manda's Triumph, South Orange Perfection, and
Jersey Beauty. There is a very distinct cross between it and _R. rugosa_
at Kew.




CHAPTER XL

PLANTING AND STAKING TREES


A few words of advice upon these important subjects will be helpful.
When planting a tree, prepare the ground beforehand, so that when the
trees arrive they can be put at once into their proper places without
having to be laid in. If the trees are to be planted thickly, trench the
ground to a depth of at least 2 feet, keeping the top spit to the top
all the while, merely burying the turf if there is any. If the soil is
poor, enrich it during the trenching. If possible this trenching should
be done the spring previous to the planting of the trees, and the ground
cropped with Potatoes or Cabbages to keep down weeds during summer. If
the trees are to be planted wide apart or as isolated specimens, make
large holes, varying in diameter from 6 to 10 feet, these being trenched
2 or 2½ feet deep and filled in again to within 1 foot of the surface.
The shape of the hole is a small matter, round or square being equally
good. In some instances, however, especially when a tree is being moved
with a large mass of soil, a square hole will be found handier than a
round one, on account of the additional room given by the corners.

The time to plant is of much importance, for though deciduous trees may
be transplanted throughout winter, October, November, February, and
March are preferable to December or January. October and November are
the two best months, as then the ground is warm and root action begins
before winter sets in.

If the trees are simply to be transplanted from one position in the
garden to another, the work may be begun in the case of deciduous trees
as soon as the leaves turn colour and commence to fall. In lifting, take
care not to injure the roots. When putting the spade into the ground the
edge should be to the tree, not the face. Digging must begin at a
reasonable distance from the tree, and if a ball of soil is not
required, the soil should be forked from between the roots into a trench
which has previously been made round the stem. If, while lifting, any of
the main roots have suffered, cut the injured parts away with a sharp
knife and tar over the wounds. When planting, the tree should be stood
in the hole, and a stick laid across the top of the hole near the tree
to ascertain whether the depth is right, sufficient space for an inch of
soil over the uppermost root being allowed. The centre of the hole
should be filled in slightly higher than the sides, and on the little
mound the tree should be stood, laying the roots out carefully all
round. When filling the soil in, some fine material should be worked in
among the roots with the hand, and before the hole is fully filled in
give a good watering; this has the effect of settling the soil well
about the roots. The amount of ramming necessary depends on the
consistency of the soil. After a tree is planted in early autumn a
mulching of rotten manure may be given, but if the planting is done in
spring the mulching is better left until early summer when the ground
has become warmed.

[Illustration: _STAKING TREES._]

After planting, staking, where necessary, should be attended to. It is
not necessary to stake every tree that is planted. When it is sturdy,
with a well-balanced head and set of roots, and the position is not
exposed to rough winds, staking is needless. If, however, the stem is
weak or the roots are mostly on one side, not spread round the tree, or
the position is very exposed, staking for a time will be necessary. In
the case of young trees little difficulty will be experienced, as good
straight stakes can be easily got. As a rule, one stake is quite enough
for a tree, and that should be driven in as close as possible to the
trunk without injuring it or the roots. To the stake the tree should be
secured with wire or stout tar string, using thin cushions of felt,
leather, or old hose-pipe to keep the wire or string from cutting into
the bark. Allow a little room between the stem and stake for growth. Two
or three ties are usually sufficient, and these should be examined and
loosened once or twice a year until the stakes can be dispensed with.
The habit of putting in stakes in such a way that they cross the trunk,
and that when the wind blows there is sufficient play for the stem and
the stake to rub against each other, is a bad one, the chafing often
causing serious wounds. In exposed situations, or when there is danger
of the tree rocking about and becoming loose at the collar, put in three
stakes in the form of a triangle, the stem fitting in the space left
between the three stakes at the top, while the bottoms of the stakes
extend some 2 or 3 feet from the tree. For this purpose wires fastened
to stakes driven in the ground are useful, and neater than stout stakes.
When wires are used, however, take care to provide a good soft pad
between the tree and the wire. For trees with large heads, or those not
well furnished with roots, this way of staking will be found very
useful. When inserting stakes they should be properly sharpened for the
sake of straight driving. The staking of trees which have the lower
parts of their trunks straight and their leaders crooked differs from
other staking, as the stakes should not be driven into the ground, but
tied firmly to the trunk below the bend, the leader being then drawn to
the stake. In all cases, however, where staking is done the stakes
should be removed as soon as the trees are able to do without them. A
stake is not beautiful. There is always the chance of the tying material
being left a little too long without examination, and therefore it cuts
into the bark. Ties also harbour insects.

SOME HARDY FLOWERING TREES AND SHRUBS


The following are tables of hardy flowering trees and shrubs, and
comprise only species and varieties suitable, unless otherwise stated,
for almost all parts of the British Isles. An asterisk (*) denotes those
of the first importance. This way has been adopted to compress as much
information as possible into a small space.

                   |                |          |China. The Catalpas are
                   |                |          |some of the most striking
                   |                |          |and beautiful of all hardy

                   |                |          |moisture. They are

                   |                |          |All the species have this
                   |                |          |peculiarity: they never

                   |                |          |In consequence of this,

                   |                |          |apex into two or three
                   |                |          |every spring, with the
                   |                |          |result that the trees
                   |                |          |naturally acquire a broad,
                   |                |          |spreading habit. This is

                   |                |          |Catalpas are seen to
                   |                |          |exceptional advantage. In

                   |                |          |America, where they are
                   |                |          |drawn up by other trees,
                   |                |          |the Catalpas occasionally
                   |                |          |attain to heights of 50
                   |                |          |feet to 100 feet. In
                   |                |          |gardens it may sometimes be
                   |                |          |advisable to help them to
                   |                |          |reach a moderate height, by
                   |                |          |keeping them to a single
                   |                |          |lead when young. All the

                   |                |          |rock-garden shrub, and very
                   |                |          |rare as yet, but well worth
                   |                |          |noting for its
                   |                |          |distinctiveness and

                   |                |          |glorious shrub. Where Broom
                   |                |          |is not plentiful as a wild
                   |                |          |plant, and therefore
                   |                |          |generally where the soil is
                   |                |          |not suitable for it, the
                   |                |          |soil should be made so; it
                   |                |          |need only be well drained
                   |                |          |and open.

                   |                |          |but in some gardens it is

*C. s. sulphureus  |Variety         |Pale      |Described by Loudon in his

                   |                |          |very pale yellow." It is a
                   |                |          |rare shrub, but should not
                   |                |          |be so. Mr. Goldring writes
                   |                |          |of it in "The Garden" as

                   |                |          |years ago, but it is still
                   |                |          |a rare shrub, not easily
                   |                |          |obtainable, though it is

C. s. flore-pleno  |Variety         |Yellow    |A so-called double variety

                   |                |          |species and varieties,
                   |                |          |contains some of the most
                   |                |          |beautiful of small garden
                   |                |          |trees, both with regard to
                   |                |          |the charm of their white,
                   |                |          |pink, and scarlet flowers,
                   |                |          |and the scarlet, black, and
                   |                |          |yellow fruits. Most of the
                   |                |          |Thorns are either large
                   |                |          |shrubs or small trees, and
                   |                |          |are specially suitable for
                   |                |          |small gardens, whilst none
                   |                |          |of them require particular
                   |                |          |attention, as all will grow
                   |                |          |in almost any soil and
                   |                |          |situation. Old trees
                   |                |          |occasionally require to be
                   |                |          |relieved of small wood and
                   |                |          |decaying branches, and a
                   |                |          |good top-dressing of manure
                   |                |          |is beneficial sometimes to
                   |                |          |those which flower and
                   |                |          |fruit freely; but beyond
                   |                |          |this Thorns need no
                   |                |          |attention after they have
                   |                |          |been planted and
                   |                |          |become established. The
                   |                |          |species can be increased by
                   |                |          |seeds, which are obtained
                   |                |          |by gathering the fruits
                   |                |          |when ripe, and mixing them
                   |                |          |with sand. The mixture of
                   |                |          |fruits and sand should then
                   |                |          |be put in a heap in a
                   |                |          |sheltered place
                   |                |          |out-of-doors, and covered
                   |                |          |with a few turfs. By the
                   |                |          |following spring the fruits
                   |                |          |will have rotted, and the
                   |                |          |seeds can be separated and
                   |                |          |sown. A fair proportion
                   |                |          |will germinate the first
                   |                |          |year, and the remainder
                   |                |          |the second. Many of the
                   |                |          |Thorns can also be
                   |                |          |propagated by root
                   |                |          |cuttings. For this purpose
                   |                |          |healthy, vigorous shoots,
                   |                |          |as thick as a man's finger,
                   |                |          |should be obtained in
                   |                |          |autumn or winter, and cut
                   |                |          |into pieces four inches to
                   |                |          |eight inches in length,
                   |                |          |cutting the end nearest the
                   |                |          |stem flat, and the other
                   |                |          |slanting, so that either
                   |                |          |end can be readily
                   |                |          |distinguished. These should

                   |                |          |charms consist in its dense
                   |                |          |glossy leaves and brilliant

                   |                |          |trellis. It is so brilliant

                   |                |          |pretty little shrub. It

                   |                |          |growing in an upward
                   |                |          |direction. The branches are
                   |                |          |short, stiff, and spiny,
                   |                |          |and what few leaves there
                   |                |          |are are small. The

                   |                |          |from the axils of short,
                   |                |          |spiny branches, and are
                   |                |          |blue. This plant has been
                   |                |          |in cultivation for a great
                   |                |          |number of years, never,
                   |                |          |however, having become at
                   |                |          |all common. This is no
                   |                |          |doubt due to the great
                   |                |          |difficulty there is in
                   |                |          |propagating it. Seeds
                   |                |          |appear to be the only means
                   |                |          |of increase, and these are
                   |                |          |borne very sparingly even
                   |                |          |when the plant is growing
                   |                |          |under natural conditions.
                   |                |          |It has been said to be a
                   |                |          |tender plant, but it has
                   |                |          |withstood several winters

FUCHSIA.--Though the genus Fuchsia is an extensive one, most of them are
of more value in the greenhouse than outdoors--that is to say,
throughout the greater part of the country. Still there are a few quite
hardy Fuchsias, for, even if cut to the ground during severe winters
they soon recover, while in particularly favoured districts, such as in
the West of England and the Isle of Wight, they grow unchecked into
large bushes, and sometimes make delightful hedges. Few flowering shrubs
are more beautiful than F. corallina and F. Riccartoni when in full
bloom. The hardiest are:--

*G. æthnensis      |Slopes of Mount |Golden    |This Broom is perfectly
                   |Etna, in Sicily |yellow;   |hardy near London. It is
                   |                |July and  |one of the rarest of shrubs
                   |                |August    |in gardens in spite of its
                   |                |          |beauty, and it flowers in
                   |                |          |July and August, a season
                   |                |          |when even inferior
                   |                |          |flowering shrubs are not
                   |                |          |plentiful. It has a rather
                   |                |          |gaunt, yet not inelegant
                   |                |          |habit, and assumes a
                   |                |          |somewhat tree-like form
                   |                |          |when old, being often
                   |                |          |reduced to a single stem at
                   |                |          |the base. It carries,
                   |                |          |however, a wide head of
                   |                |          |thin cord-like, arching or
                   |                |          |pendulous branches, with
                   |                |          |little or no foliage except
                   |                |          |when the wood is quite
                   |                |          |young. The flowers are of a
                   |                |          |rich golden-yellow, and
                   |                |          |during the series of hot
                   |                |          |summers we have experienced

                   |                |          |especially abundant. It
                   |                |          |would, indeed, be difficult
                   |                |          |to find a shrub better
                   |                |          |adapted for hot, light
                   |                |          |soils than this, a fact
                   |                |          |that is amply proved by the
                   |                |          |way it succeeds at Kew. It
                   |                |          |is a good plant for
                   |                |          |associating with
                   |                |          |medium-sized evergreens,
                   |                |          |which hide its bare stems
                   |                |          |and render it more
                   |                |          |effective when in flower.
                   |                |          |It grows 10 feet to 14 feet
                   |                |          |high, and is thus one of
                   |                |          |the tallest--if not the
                   |                |          |tallest--of the Brooms
                   |                |          |hardy in Britain. It ripens
                   |                |          |seed freely, and is best
                   |                |          |propagated by that means.

                   |                |          |rather straggling branches,
                   |                |          |every little twig of which

                   |                |          |length, and covered with
                   |                |          |white, silky hairs on the
                   |                |          |under side and a few
                   |                |          |scattered ones on the upper
                   |                |          |surface. Easily raised from

                   |                |          |attracted the notice of the
                   |                |          |earlier colonists, and it
                   |                |          |was, in fact, introduced to
                   |                |          |Britain as long ago as
                   |                |          |1736. During the last

                   |                |          |in autumn. It has the
                   |                |          |narrow, twisted, bright
                   |                |          |yellow petals which, with

                   |                |          |valuable from the fact that

                   |                |          |plant should be male and

                   |                |          |the utmost importance, and

                   |                |          |Mr. Davis made this the

                   |                |          |parent, and found the
                   |                |          |seedlings from it to vary
                   |                |          |considerably in the
                   |                |          |character of the foliage
                   |                |          |and colour of the fruit.
                   |                |          |This encouraged him to
                   |                |          |take seed from the best
                   |                |          |of his seedlings, and

Prunus (Rosaceæ)   |......          |......    |This is a beautiful genus.
                   |                |          |As at present constituted
                   |                |          |it contains all those trees
                   |                |          |which were formerly and in
                   |                |          |many places still are
                   |                |          |included under the generic
                   |                |          |titles of Amygdalus,
                   |                |          |Persica, Cerasus, Padus,
                   |                |          |&c. The genus is divided
                   |                |          |into six sections, viz.,
                   |                |          |Amygdalus, which includes
                   |                |          |Almonds and Peaches;
                   |                |          |Armeniaca, the Apricots;
                   |                |          |Prunus, which contains the
                   |                |          |true Plums and the
                   |                |          |Blackthorn; Cerasus, the
                   |                |          |various Cherries; Padus,
                   |                |          |the Bird Cherries; and
                   |                |          |Laurocerasus, under which
                   |                |          |is placed the Cherry
                   |                |          |Laurel, Portugal Laurel,
                   |                |          |&c. Although these genera
                   |                |          |may differ outwardly, yet
                   |                |          |they are botanically of the
                   |                |          |same character. The genus
                   |                |          |is widely spread,
                   |                |          |representatives being found
                   |                |          |in Europe and through Asia
                   |                |          |southward to Persia and
                   |                |          |Afghanistan, and eastward
                   |                |          |to China and Japan; it is
                   |                |          |also well represented in
                   |                |          |North America. With the
                   |                |          |exception of the section
                   |                |          |Laurocerasus, all the
                   |                |          |members of the genus are
                   |                |          |deciduous trees or shrubs
                   |                |          |of various sizes, and most
                   |                |          |of them are very beautiful,
                   |                |          |especially in spring. A
                   |                |          |fairly light well-drained
                   |                |          |soil is best. If inclined
                   |                |          |to be cold and heavy and is
                   |                |          |not very deep, the plums or
                   |                |          |any which succeed on the
                   |                |          |plum stock, are best, as
                   |                |          |they are more
                   |                |          |surface-rooting than the
                   |                |          |remainder. The presence of
                   |                |          |lime in the soil is highly
                   |                |          |beneficial to all the
                   |                |          |Prunuses and, if not
                   |                |          |naturally present, can
                   |                |          |easily be given in the form
                   |                |          |of old mortar-rubbish
                   |                |          |forked in liberally round
                   |                |          |them. Propagation is
                   |                |          |effected by seeds,
                   |                |          |cuttings, layers, or by
                   |                |          |budding or grafting.
                   |                |          |Details of propagation will
                   |                |          |be found with each section.

Prunus (the Plums) |                |          |There are several species
                   |                |          |of Prunus, but those
                   |                |          |mentioned are the most
                   |                |          |important for gardens. The
                   |                |          |Plums are best grown from
                   |                |          |seeds, but if these cannot
                   |                |          |be got then they must be
                   |                |          |worked upon the Wild,
                   |                |          |Mussel, and Myrobella or
                   |                |          |Myrobalan Plum. Plum stocks
                   |                |          |should be raised from seed.
                   |                |          |If got from layers or
                   |                |          |suckers they are liable to
                   |                |          |throw up suckers from the
                   |                |          |base, and ruin the plants

P. cerasifera      |Uncertain, but  |Small,    |This is the well-known
(P. mirobalana)    |probably of     |pure      |Myrobalan Plum, and the
                   |Caucasian origin|white;    |seedlings are used as
                   |                |Spring    |stocks. Its hardiness and
                   |                |          |vigour in almost all soils
                   |                |          |and climates make it a good
                   |                |          |small shrub, and its white
                   |                |          |flower-clusters are
                   |                |          |delightful in early spring.
                   |                |          |The fruits are popular on
                   |                |          |the Continent, and are red
                   |                |          |in colour. It is used as a
                   |                |          |hedge in some places. There
                   |                |          |are two varieties, viz.,
                   |                |          |angustifolia pendula, which
                   |                |          |is half pendulous in
                   |                |          |growth, and the well-known
                   |                |          |atropurpurea, more often
                   |                |          |called *P. Pissardi, which
                   |                |          |is a native of Persia, and

                   |                |          |which get darker with age.
                   |                |          |The flowers are
                   |                |          |rose-tinted. It is a good
                   |                |          |shrub for colour, but must

                   |                |          |propagated by cuttings,

                   |                |          |and inserted nearly their

                   |                |          |the ground should be deeply

                   |                |          |during Spring and Summer it
                   |                |          |is quite silvery. Although
                   |                |          |about 20 feet high in its
                   |                |          |native country, it makes
                   |                |          |here, as a rule, a small

*P. salicifolia    |Levant          |          |A beautiful tree, about 15

Pear)              |                |          |to make groups of for the
                   |                |          |sake of its long and narrow
                   |                |          |silvery-white leaves. There
                   |                |          |is a creeping variety of
                   |                |          |it. The flowers are white,
                   |                |          |and the fruits small and
                   |                |          |woody, neither of much
                   |                |          |account. It is the effect
                   |                |          |of the foliage that we must
                   |                |          |consider, which is very
                   |                |          |charming when waving in the
                   |                |          |wind. A good tree for
                   |                |          |grouping and for small
                   |                |          |gardens, and this remark
                   |                |          |applies also to the weeping
                   |                |          |form. The Pyrophorum group
                   |                |          |will come true from seed,
                   |                |          |which is the best way of
                   |                |          |propagating them. If not
                   |                |          |from seeds they can be
                   |                |          |worked on stocks of the
                   |                |          |Wild Pear, on which they do
                   |                |          |fairly well, though much
                   |                |          |better on their own roots.
                   |                |          |There are other species in

                   |                |          |it is not inferior in
                   |                |          |beauty to any of them. It
                   |                |          |is only in recent years
                   |                |          |that it has been in
                   |                |          |commerce. It has not, of
                   |                |          |course, reached its full
                   |                |          |size yet in this country,
                   |                |          |but it is evidently going
                   |                |          |to be a small tree. It is
                   |                |          |nearly related to P.
                   |                |          |floribunda, but gives every
                   |                |          |indication of possessing a
                   |                |          |more tree-like character,
                   |                |          |its branches being sturdier
                   |                |          |and more erect in growth.
                   |                |          |But it is for its wealth of
                   |                |          |blossom that it is chiefly
                   |                |          |remarkable. Even among such
                   |                |          |profuse-flowering things as
                   |                |          |those of its allies
                   |                |          |mentioned above, it is
                   |                |          |noteworthy for its
                   |                |          |qualities in that respect.

                   |                |          |with blossom. The flowers
                   |                |          |are semi-double and come in
                   |                |          |the usual Apple-like
                   |                |          |clusters; each flower is
                   |                |          |about 1½ inches across.

*P. spectabilis    |China and Japan |Pink;     |A beautiful and fairly well
(Chinese Crab)     |                |Spring    |known tree, 20 feet to 30
                   |                |          |feet high, with large
                   |                |          |semi-double flowers of much
                   |                |          |charm; the fruits are
                   |                |          |bright red. Every garden
                   |                |          |should possess a group of
                   |                |          |it, and at least a single
                   |                |          |specimen standing out by
                   |                |          |itself, unfettered by trees
                   |                |          |or shrubs near. There are
                   |                |          |three varieties of note:
                   |                |          |flore-pleno-albo, with
                   |                |          |white flowers; flore-pleno;
                   |                |          |and Kaido, which is a very
                   |                |          |charming tree, upright in
                   |                |          |growth, and with rose-pink
                   |                |          |flowers and yellowish-red
                   |                |          |fruits. These trees of the
                   |                |          |Malus section are usually
                   |                |          |propagated by being budded
                   |                |          |or grafted on stocks of the
                   |                |          |Common Crab. If any of them
                   |                |          |are growing singly away
                   |                |          |from other species, then
                   |                |          |seeds from them will come
                   |                |          |true to name, but where
                   |                |          |various species are growing
                   |                |          |together they become
                   |                |          |crossed when in flower, and
                   |                |          |the seedlings result in a
                   |                |          |variety of hybrids, few or
                   |                |          |none of which are of any
                   |                |          |value. But as all of them
                   |                |          |succeed very well when
                   |                |          |worked on Stocks of the
                   |                |          |Common Crab, this is
                   |                |          |probably the better way to
                   |                |          |propagate them.

                   |                |          |districts. It is a large
                   |                |          |tree, 40 to 50 feet high,
                   |                |          |and has oval leaves, which

                   |                |          |flowers are borne in large
                   |                |          |clusters, followed by oval

                   |                |          |very handsome, with its
                   |                |          |broad and silvery leaves;
                   |                |          |chrysophylla has leaves of
                   |                |          |quite a golden hue; græca

                   |                |          |Greece, it is much later in
                   |                |          |flowering and fruiting than
                   |                |          |any of the others;
                   |                |          |salicifolia has striking
                   |                |          |leaves, quite silvery white

                   |                |          |broad, silvery beneath. The
                   |                |          |pinkish flowers are on
                   |                |          |large dense corymbs,
                   |                |          |followed by bright scarlet
                   |                |          |fruits. A tree well worth

                   |                |          |are an additional charm.

                   |                |          |that a description is
                   |                |          |almost needless, but there
                   |                |          |are several varieties, with

                   |                |          |scarlet. We give the six
                   |                |          |from the Kew list:
                   |                |          |candicans, white;
                   |                |          |luteo-viridis, yellow;

                   |                |          |nivalis, white; sulphurea
                   |                |          |perfecta and versicolor
                   |                |          |lutescens, both yellowish.
                   |                |          |All the varieties are good,
                   |                |          |especially Knap-Hill

                   |                |          |delightful in a group; it
                   |                |          |is a most valuable shrub.
                   |                |          |Sinica has very showy deep

R. HARDY HYBRID    |Ericaceæ        |......    |Very few of the species of
                   |                |          |Rhododendron have not some
                   |                |          |value either for out of
                   |                |          |doors or under glass.
                   |                |          |Rhododendrons are widely
                   |                |          |distributed, species being
                   |                |          |found in North America,
                   |                |          |Europe, and through
                   |                |          |temperate Asia as far south
                   |                |          |as the Malay Peninsula, the
                   |                |          |headquarters of the genus
                   |                |          |being Western Asia and the
                   |                |          |temperate Himalaya.
                   |                |          |Rhododendrons also differ
                   |                |          |greatly in size, some very
                   |                |          |tall as R. arborea, which
                   |                |          |is sometimes said to grow
                   |                |          |to a height of 40 feet in
                   |                |          |the Sikkim forests, to the
                   |                |          |little alpine R.
                   |                |          |Chamæcistus, which rarely
                   |                |          |exceeds 6 inches high.
                   |                |          |There is quite as marked
                   |                |          |variation in the size of
                   |                |          |the leaf, several species,
                   |                |          |of which R. Falconeri may
                   |                |          |be taken as a type, having
                   |                |          |large and handsome leaves,
                   |                |          |sometimes a foot high and 6
                   |                |          |inches wide, whilst the
                   |                |          |quaint little Japanese

                   |                |          |has tiny leaves not a third
                   |                |          |of an inch long and of
                   |                |          |corresponding width. The
                   |                |          |Rhododendron family may be
                   |                |          |divided into two great
                   |                |          |sections, deciduous and
                   |                |          |evergreen. The evergreen
                   |                |          |section consists of a large
                   |                |          |number of species, either
                   |                |          |quite hardy or tender, the
                   |                |          |tender ones being
                   |                |          |represented by such

                   |                |          |the Malayan species, &c.
                   |                |          |With the exception of R.
                   |                |          |ponticum true species are
                   |                |          |seldom met with outdoors,
                   |                |          |except in gardens where
                   |                |          |collections are formed, or
                   |                |          |in the south-west
                   |                |          |countries. The scarcity of
                   |                |          |species is doubtless due to
                   |                |          |many of the hybrids being
                   |                |          |much hardier, and begin to
                   |                |          |flower and grow at a later
                   |                |          |time of the year. Although
                   |                |          |some of them will stand
                   |                |          |severe frost in mid-winter
                   |                |          |without injury, growth
                   |                |          |beginning early in the
                   |                |          |year, the young leaves and
                   |                |          |shoots get considerably
                   |                |          |injured by the late spring
                   |                |          |frosts, and flowers when
                   |                |          |open in March are also
                   |                |          |destroyed or much spoilt.

                   |                |          |to receive protection from

                   |                |          |according to parentage. Of
                   |                |          |these groups by far the
                   |                |          |most familiar is the one
                   |                |          |that has originated through
                   |                |          |the crossing and
                   |                |          |intercrossing of the
                   |                |          |Himalayan R. arboreum

                   |                |          |catawbiense, the Caucasian
                   |                |          |species R. caucasicum, or
                   |                |          |the European and Asiatic
                   |                |          |ponticum. This hybridising
                   |                |          |has been progressing for
                   |                |          |half a century or more,
                   |                |          |and the parentage is
                   |                |          |plainly seen in the
                   |                |          |offspring. Thus where R.
                   |                |          |arboreum asserts itself
                   |                |          |most strongly we find rich
                   |                |          |red flowers and leaves
                   |                |          |with a silvery
                   |                |          |under-surface. Where R.
                   |                |          |catawbiense is most in
                   |                |          |evidence the leaves are
                   |                |          |large and handsome, deep
                   |                |          |green, and softer to the
                   |                |          |touch than R. arboreum,
                   |                |          |while the clusters are
                   |                |          |often of great size, the
                   |                |          |flowers prettily spotted,
                   |                |          |and the plants of
                   |                |          |exceptionally good habit.
                   |                |          |For very cold districts the
                   |                |          |catawbiense hybrids are the
                   |                |          |best, being hardier than
                   |                |          |the others. The flowers of
                   |                |          |many of the earliest of the
                   |                |          |R. catawbiense hybrids are
                   |                |          |of lilac or purple
                   |                |          |colouring. The influence of
                   |                |          |R. caucasicum is most
                   |                |          |plainly shown in the rose,
                   |                |          |white, and heavily spotted

                   |                |          |probably the finest species
                   |                |          |of Rhododendron in
                   |                |          |existence, and named in
                   |                |          |honour of Lord Auckland, a
                   |                |          |Governor-General of India,
                   |                |          |by Sir Joseph Hooker. It
                   |                |          |appears, however, to have
                   |                |          |previously been named after
                   |                |          |Griffith, the Indian
                   |                |          |botanist, whose name it
                   |                |          |ought now properly to bear.
                   |                |          |It carries its flowers in
                   |                |          |large, loose trusses, and
                   |                |          |individually they are
                   |                |          |frequently 6 inches across.
                   |                |          |This Rhododendron, we
                   |                |          |believe, ranks first in the
                   |                |          |genus in regard to the size
                   |                |          |of its bloom. Six or eight
                   |                |          |of these are borne in a
                   |                |          |truss, and they are pure
                   |                |          |white when once fully
                   |                |          |expanded, although pink in
                   |                |          |the bud state. The handsome
                   |                |          |leaves are smooth,
                   |                |          |narrow-oblong, 6 inches to
                   |                |          |12 inches long, and of a
                   |                |          |deep lustrous green. When
                   |                |          |fully grown this becomes a
                   |                |          |small tree, the bark
                   |                |          |peeling from the trunk in
                   |                |          |large flakes. It is not,
                   |                |          |unfortunately, one of the
                   |                |          |Himalayan species that can
                   |                |          |be grown out of doors near
                   |                |          |London. In Cornwall and
                   |                |          |similar places it is
                   |                |          |magnificent. It only just
                   |                |          |escapes being hardy, and
                   |                |          |can be grown out of doors
                   |                |          |in tubs for the greater
                   |                |          |part of the year. Some of
                   |                |          |the best specimens in the
                   |                |          |country have, in fact, been
                   |                |          |grown in this way. Even

                   |                |          |without injury. It is
                   |                |          |remarkable that this
                   |                |          |Rhododendron has not been
                   |                |          |used more for hybridising.
                   |                |          |Most people seem to have
                   |                |          |been slow in awakening to
                   |                |          |its value, and although, at
                   |                |          |the present time, there are

                   |                |          |group will be better known,
                   |                |          |as many of the hybrids are
                   |                |          |very charming, a few having
                   |                |          |names; thus those raised at
                   |                |          |Kew were named respectively
                   |                |          |Mrs. Thiselton-Dyer and
                   |                |          |George Thiselton-Dyer. They
                   |                |          |bloom profusely, the
                   |                |          |flowers being very deep
                   |                |          |rose with dust-brownish
                   |                |          |blotches at the base; the
                   |                |          |chief difference is that
                   |                |          |the flowers of the former
                   |                |          |are paler than those of the
                   |                |          |latter. An interesting
                   |                |          |hybrid raised at Kew by
                   |                |          |crossing R. Fortunei with
                   |                |          |the variety Meteor has
                   |                |          |flowered well for the last
                   |                |          |four years. The cross was
                   |                |          |made in 1893, and the
                   |                |          |plants flowered when only a
                   |                |          |few inches high. Several
                   |                |          |plants have now grown to a
                   |                |          |height of 2½ feet. The
                   |                |          |flowers are in compact,
                   |                |          |rounded trusses, and appear
                   |                |          |in May; they are delicate
                   |                |          |pink, and fragrant. The
                   |                |          |great peculiarity of the
                   |                |          |hybrid is that no plant has
                   |                |          |perfect stamens, some being
                   |                |          |full size but barren,
                   |                |          |others reduced to mere
                   |                |          |specks, and occasionally
                   |                |          |they are quite absent.

R. Smirnowi        |Native of       |Bright    |This is a handsome species,

                   |                |          |resulted from crossing the

                   |                |          |hybrid Johnsoni in 1893. It
                   |                |          |flowered when four years
                   |                |          |old, and was of dwarf
                   |                |          |growth, with rosy-red
                   |                |          |flower. Of numerous other
                   |                |          |hybrids raised since then
                   |                |          |three resulted from
                   |                |          |crosses made in May 1896;
                   |                |          |they flowered in May 1902,
                   |                |          |and are so far the best.
                   |                |          |One of these was raised by
                   |                |          |crossing with the variety
                   |                |          |purpureum splendens; this
                   |                |          |has trusses of purplish
                   |                |          |flowers. Another claims R.

                   |                |          |parent; it has large
                   |                |          |fragrant flowers with five
                   |                |          |or six petals, pink, and

                   |                |          |trusses. In the third case
                   |                |          |kewense was selected as the
                   |                |          |male, and this is the
                   |                |          |prettiest of the three; the
                   |                |          |flowers are on long stalks,
                   |                |          |droop, and have daintily
                   |                |          |fringed petals; they are
                   |                |          |fragrant, rose colour,
                   |                |          |mottled with dark spots in

                   |                |          |drooping character of the
                   |                |          |flowers is not an
                   |                |          |advantage.

                   |                |          |Although in the making of
                   |                |          |the two genera the number
                   |                |          |of stamens was considered
                   |                |          |one of the principal
                   |                |          |points, it has since been
                   |                |          |shown that it is a point
                   |                |          |unworthy of notice, as the
                   |                |          |number of stamens varies
                   |                |          |considerably in both

                   |                |          |species. It is doubtful
                   |                |          |whether the name of Azalea
                   |                |          |will disappear, but we are
                   |                |          |following here the latest
                   |                |          |classification, and
                   |                |          |therefore place the
                   |                |          |"Azalea" in its proper
                   |                |          |group. About 20 species
                   |                |          |have been known under the
                   |                |          |name of Azalea, 3 or 4 of
                   |                |          |which are evergreen, and
                   |                |          |the remainder deciduous. Of
                   |                |          |these about half-a-dozen
                   |                |          |are really well known in
                   |                |          |gardens, either by the type
                   |                |          |plants, hybrids, or garden
                   |                |          |forms. The majority of the
                   |                |          |species belong to China and
                   |                |          |Japan and North America,

                   |                |          |splendid breeders, and in

                   |                |          |a wonderful assortment of
                   |                |          |varieties has been
                   |                |          |obtained, which for
                   |                |          |delicate shades and rich
                   |                |          |self-colourings are
                   |                |          |unsurpassed among hardy
                   |                |          |shrubs. The colours range
                   |                |          |from white to pink and from
                   |                |          |pink to blood-red, from

                   |                |          |originated; flavum has been
                   |                |          |responsible for many of the
                   |                |          |yellows and terra-cottas;
                   |                |          |arborescens, occidentale,
                   |                |          |and viscosum for the whites
                   |                |          |and pale rose varieties,
                   |                |          |also for the late flowering
                   |                |          |ones; while R. nudiflorum
                   |                |          |has been responsible for a
                   |                |          |great number of hybrids of
                   |                |          |all shades. As a rule it is
                   |                |          |much easier to trace R.

                   |                |          |than that of other species,
                   |                |          |the flowers in that case
                   |                |          |being larger and the leaves
                   |                |          |more closely resembling
                   |                |          |those of the species, but
                   |                |          |even in some of these
                   |                |          |repeated intercrossing has
                   |                |          |almost obliterated the
                   |                |          |special sinense characters.
                   |                |          |Many of these hybrids have
                   |                |          |been raised in the
                   |                |          |old-world city of Ghent, a
                   |                |          |fact which has given rise
                   |                |          |to the name "Ghent
                   |                |          |Azaleas." In England Mr.
                   |                |          |Anthony Waterer has raised
                   |                |          |beautiful forms at
                   |                |          |Knaphill, such as the pure

                   |                |          |Few are named, however,
                   |                |          |nowadays, this brilliant

                   |                |          |"Knaphill," and it is rich
                   |                |          |in beautiful colours, from
                   |                |          |white through yellow,
                   |                |          |orange, buff, crimson,
                   |                |          |scarlet, and other flaming
                   |                |          |tones, which create
                   |                |          |glorious pictures in the
                   |                |          |garden in late Spring and
                   |                |          |early Summer. The shrubs
                   |                |          |should be planted in groups
                   |                |          |in woodland and elsewhere
                   |                |          |when the rich colouring of
                   |                |          |the flowers is most
                   |                |          |effective, and in Autumn
                   |                |          |the foliage turns to warm
                   |                |          |tints, crimson, brown,

                   |                |          |intermingling, making the
                   |                |          |bushes almost as beautiful
                   |                |          |in their Autumn dress as

                   |                |          |in Spring and early Summer.
                   |                |          |Of late years these
                   |                |          |Rhododendrons, especially
                   |                |          |the sinense group, have
                   |                |          |been much used for forcing,
                   |                |          |and they are extremely
                   |                |          |useful for that purpose, as
                   |                |          |has been so well
                   |                |          |demonstrated by the
                   |                |          |brilliant groups exhibited
                   |                |          |at various meetings of the
                   |                |          |Royal Horticultural Society
                   |                |          |by Messrs Cuthbert and
                   |                |          |other firms. When planting
                   |                |          |these hardy Azaleas, choose
                   |                |          |a sheltered position, not
                   |                |          |because they are tender,
                   |                |          |but to protect the flowers
                   |                |          |as much as possible from
                   |                |          |cold winds and late frosts.
                   |                |          |The majority of them are in
                   |                |          |bloom before the time of
                   |                |          |frosts has passed, and
                   |                |          |sometimes the flowers get
                   |                |          |destroyed wholesale. Few
                   |                |          |shrubs are more suitable
                   |                |          |for planting in woodland or
                   |                |          |on the fringe of walks in
                   |                |          |single groups, as here the
                   |                |          |colours are fully brought
                   |                |          |out. A peat soil or a
                   |                |          |mixture of loam and peat
                   |                |          |will provide quite suitable
                   |                |          |material. Mr. Anthony

                   |                |          |not absolutely safe there;
                   |                |          |several specimens were
                   |                |          |killed by the severe frost
                   |                |          |of a few winters ago. A
                   |                |          |certain amount of
                   |                |          |protection is desirable,
                   |                |          |but undue coddling often
                   |                |          |leads to the plant rotting
                   |                |          |to the root stock and so
                   |                |          |perishing. The Romneya is
                   |                |          |very impatient of root
                   |                |          |disturbance. When once
                   |                |          |established in the open
                   |                |          |ground, however, it grows
                   |                |          |strongly. The seeds take a
                   |                |          |long while to germinate.
                   |                |          |The plants may also be
                   |                |          |raised from root cuttings
                   |                |          |and layers. When growing in
                   |                |          |the rock-garden it often
                   |                |          |sends out shoots at some

The common Lilac has been the glory of English gardens since the days of
Gerard and Parkinson of the sixteenth century. From the time that
Parkinson grew it in a pot, with no doubt as much care and anxiety as is
bestowed nowadays on a hundred-guinea Orchid, the Lilac has, on account
of its extreme hardiness and easy culture, become almost naturalised in
these islands, as now we see it in copse and hedgerow, besides gardens
large and small, and even in the town forecourt. To every place where
the Englishman goes to make a home he likes to have about him Lilacs and
Roses. As in the case of several other beautiful shrubs, the improvement
of the Lilac by the raising of new varieties is of comparatively recent
date. Gerard and Parkinson write of the blue Pipe and the white Pipe
(the Lilac being then called the Pipe tree, on account of pipes being
made from its wood), besides the ordinary lilac-coloured sort, and
Loudon, writing fifty years ago, only enumerates the blue (cærulea),
violet (violacea), the white (alba), and alba major, and one double
called alba plena, seven in all. He just mentions, however, a fine
variety, Caroli (or Charles X., as we know it), which about that time
had been raised in France. This still is one of the choicest sorts, and
particularly valuable for forcing into early bloom in winter. Since that
time there has been great activity in raising new kinds in France, till
now the list of named single sorts numbers upwards of fifty, while the
doubles are almost as numerous. There are far too many named sorts, in
fact, as the differences between many of them are of the slightest, so
that the selection of the best from catalogues, from the mere names and
brief descriptions (not always accurate) is perplexing to an amateur. To
no raiser do we owe more to the improvement of the Lilac of late years
than to that famous veteran French hybridist, Victor Lemoine of Nancy,
who has made the genus Syringa one of his special studies, and favoured
as he is by a climate suitable for the free seeding of the Lilac, he has
been highly successful. There are four more or less distinct shades of
colour among the sorts, viz. whites, reds, pinks, and so-called blues. A
selection of a dozen single sorts would include the following, placed in
order of merit: _Whites_--Marie Le Gray, Alba grandiflora. _Blue or
Bluish_--Cærulea or Delphine, Duchesse de Namours, Lindleyana or Dr.
Lindley. _Reds or Purple-reds_--Souvenir de L. Späth, Philemon, Rubra
insignis, Mme. Kreuter, Camille de Rohan, Ville de Troyes.
_Pinks_--Lovanensis, Schneelavine. This selection comprises the finest
sorts, having the largest flower clusters in their respective colours,
and is representative of the whole of the sorts. Of the double flowered
sorts there has of recent years been a great number sent from French
nurseries, and only a few of the oldest sorts have developed into large
specimens, and therefore one cannot judge of their merits, as in the
case of the single sorts. The best varieties include the following dozen
sorts: _Lavender and Blue_--Leon Simon, Renoncule, Alphonse Lavallée
(pale blue). _Pinks_--President Carnot, M. de Dombasle. _Whites_--Mme.
Abel Chatenay (the finest), Mme. Lemoine, Cassimir fils.
_Reds_--President Grévy, Senateur Volland, Comte H. de Choiseul, Maxime
Cornu. In the Lilacs there is material for the tasteful planter of
gardens, yet how seldom does one see in ordinary gardens full advantage
taken of them for producing beautiful effects! In the common way of
planting they are dotted about shrubberies indiscriminately, and jumbled
with trees and shrubs of a totally different character, so that the
Lilacs cannot be seen to the fullest advantage. An isolated group of the
choicest kinds, or even a simple hedge of the white or rich purple kinds
is seldom seen, except in some old gardens, and still less seldom does
one see any attempt at culture in the way of pruning and the cutting
away of suckers. At Kew one may see bold examples of grouping Lilacs, as
well as well-developed specimens standing alone on grass, while about
London one sees in the market gardens fine hedges of Lilac planted for
the twofold purpose of cutting from and providing shelter. Mr. Goldring
writes in _The Garden_, "The most beautiful Lilac hedge I have seen was
that I enjoyed recently at the White Farm, Crichel (an enclosure devoted
to white animals), where there are glorious hedges of the pure white
Lilac Marie Le Gray in abundant flower--quite appropriate to the white
surroundings. The only culture the Lilacs require is occasional manuring
in light, poor soils, occasional pruning so as to induce a bushy growth,
as the growth is apt to become 'leggy,' and continuous attention in
cutting away suckers, which are so plentiful as to rob the tops. Two or
three suckers should be allowed to grow so as to keep up the supply of
strong, vigorous flowering stems. Lilacs can be made to form standards
by keeping the bush from the outset to one stem, and when seen rising
out of a low hedge of Lilac, or a mass of the dwarf kinds, they have a
pleasing effect, and is one of the various ways they can be arranged in
planting."

                   |                |          |are several varieties.
                   |                |          |Lucidum is the finest; the
                   |                |          |leaves and corymbs are
                   |                |          |larger than those of the
                   |                |          |type, the former being of a
                   |                |          |very glossy green and
                   |                |          |smooth. In lucidum the
                   |                |          |leaves and branches are
                   |                |          |woolly, whilst there are
                   |                |          |also purpureum, with
                   |                |          |purplish leaves, and a
                   |                |          |variegated variety, but
                   |                |          |neither is of value.

                   |                |          |grown, and I have heard
                   |                |          |doubts expressed as to its
                   |                |          |being hardy enough to stand
                   |                |          |the winter in some
                   |                |          |districts. Not long ago I
                   |                |          |saw a fine specimen in a
                   |                |          |Kentish rectory garden. The
                   |                |          |tree is 5 feet or 6 feet
                   |                |          |high, and under the shelter
                   |                |          |of a thick hedge of
                   |                |          |Laurustinus it flowers
                   |                |          |freely every year, and also
                   |                |          |produces fruit. The long
                   |                |          |white and slightly tinted
                   |                |          |blooms, which change to
                   |                |          |purple, are very effective,
                   |                |          |but one rarely gets an
                   |                |          |opportunity of seeing this
                   |                |          |interesting tree in flower.
                   |                |          |Perhaps this is because it
                   |                |          |does not belong to the
                   |                |          |common order of things, or
                   |                |          |else it is not
                   |                |          |accommodating enough for
                   |                |          |general culture, but it is
                   |                |          |very beautiful." The
                   |                |          |Xanthoceras is sometimes
                   |                |          |trained against a wall, but
                   |                |          |its growth is too stiff for
                   |                |          |the purpose. The flowers
                   |                |          |are in dense spikes about 6
                   |                |          |inches long, reminding one
                   |                |          |of the Horse-Chestnut, and
                   |                |          |are an inch across
                   |                |          |individually. The foliage
                   |                |          |is very ornamental, and
                   |                |          |each leaf-stalk has seven
                   |                |          |pinnate, serrated,

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
