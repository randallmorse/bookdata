INTRODUCTION


This Supplement is designed to supply a double need: it furnishes an
analytical index to the entire series of twenty volumes; and it affords
a great deal of additional information, bearing on the subject-matter of
these volumes, but which from its very nature it was impossible to
incorporate in the text. This additional information includes
biographical sketches of the characters mentioned in each volume;
similar sketches of prominent Canadians who for one reason or another do
not appear in any of the twenty volumes; and brief descriptions of wars,
battles, treaties, and political and other events having a vital bearing
on the history of Canada. References have been added, wherever
necessary, to the principal sources which the student may consult for
further information. The whole has been thrown into one alphabetical
arrangement, and it constitutes, to a large extent, a dictionary of
Canadian history.

To satisfy further the desire of those who, after reading the foregoing
volumes, find it profitable to investigate more fully certain lines of
inquiry suggested by the narratives, it has been thought advisable to
add a list of manuscript sources from which new material may be gleaned.
The collection of documents most convenient for this purpose is to be
found in the Dominion Archives. It is not possible in the present work
to do more than indicate the principal documents, as there are fifteen
thousand volumes of manuscript in the Archives bearing on Canadian
history. The sources indicated here are drawn principally from the
series designated A, B, C, F, Q, M. The letter refers to the series, and
the number to the volume. The Calendars published by the Archives in the
Annual Reports should also be consulted by the student. For convenience
of reference, it has been deemed preferable to group the manuscript
sources under general headings, and print the list as a separate section
in the volume.

In the preparation of the bibliographical references, the object has
been to include only those works that have a direct and vital bearing on
the subject. A complete bibliography in each case would obviously be
neither possible nor desirable. Nor, except in special cases, has any
attempt been made to include articles or papers in periodicals or in the
publications of learned societies. It will be sufficient to make a
general reference here to some of the more important sources of
information on the many topics covered in this volume. First among these
sources probably should rank the publications of the Royal Society of
Canada. The Society has published in a separate volume a very full
General Index to its _Proceedings and Transactions_, 1882-1906, compiled
by Dr. Benjamin Sulte. For volumes subsequent to 1906, the individual
indexes should be consulted. A key to the Annual Reports of the
Geological Survey of Canada is found in two General Indexes, one
covering the years 1863-1884, and the other the years 1885-1906. The
latter, compiled by F. J. Nicolas, is very complete. Wurtële's Index to
the _Transactions_ and other Publications of the Literary and Historical
Society of Quebec, 1829-1891, furnishes a guide to the material issued
by this oldest of Canadian learned societies. Unfortunately, no general
index is available for the publications of the Canadian Institute, which
cover a very wide and important field; nor for those of the Historical
and Scientific Society of Manitoba, the Ontario Historical Society, the
Nova Scotia Historical Society, and various other Canadian institutions
of a similar character. Much important material, bearing on, or
supplementary to, the topics treated in the several volumes of the
_Makers of Canada_ will be found in the foregoing publications. The
reader may also find it profitable in many cases to consult the
publications of the American Historical Association, and the State
Historical Societies of New York, Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota. A great deal of important material is also to be found in
Canadian and other periodicals. Of the more significant of these, the
_Revue Canadienne_ marked the completion of its fifty-third volume in
1907 by publishing in separate form a comprehensive Index to the entire
series up to that year. In consulting other Canadian magazines,
reference must in most cases be made to the individual indexes in each
volume. The series of the _Canadian Monthly_ and the _New Dominion
Monthly_ are, however, fully covered by Poole's _Index_; the _Canadian
Magazine_, to a large extent, by Wilson's _Guide to Periodical
Literature_, as well as by a General Index published by the magazine in
1907. A key to the publications of several Canadian historical societies
and periodicals, since the year 1906, is furnished by the _Magazine
Subject-Index_ (Boston). The three admirable American guides mentioned
above, that is, Poole's _Index_, Wilson's _Guide_, and the _Magazine
Subject-Index_, with their annual or cumulative supplements, provide
also a key to the great body of literature in the principal American and
English periodicals, bearing on Canadian topics.

Among other important guides to Canadian subjects, historical,
political, biographical, social, literary, and scientific, should be
mentioned the _Review of Historical Publications Relating to Canada_,
edited by Wrong and Langton; Larned's _Literature of American History_,
which includes a section on Canada; the various encyclopædias; the
annual bibliographies of Canadian scientific work published in the
_Transactions_ of the Royal Society of Canada; Gagnon's _Essai de
Bibliographie Canadienne_; Morgan's _Bibliotheca Canadensis_; James's
_Bibliography of Canadian Verse_; Horning and Burpee's _Bibliography of
Canadian Fiction_; Tanguay's _Dictionnaire Généalogique des Familles
Canadiennes_; and the very full bibliographies of material published in
or about the province of Quebec, by Dr. N. E. Dionne. A general
reference may also be made here, for all subjects in this volume
relating to Canadian history, to such general works as those of Parkman,
Kingsford, Bourinot, Dent, McMullen, Ferland, Faillon, Charlevoix,
Bibaud, Garneau, Sulte, Miles, Christie, Haliburton, Murdoch, Campbell,
Hannay, Bryce, and Begg. In addition to the principal source of Canadian
manuscript material, the Archives at Ottawa, a large number of important
documents will be found in the Provincial Archives at Halifax, Quebec,
Toronto, Winnipeg, and Victoria, as well as in the universities of
Laval, McGill, and Toronto. Finally, reference may be made to the
various biographical dictionaries in the accompanying list.

The inclusion in the Supplement of several names of Canadians, both
living and dead, who are not of the very first importance, and the
omission of others who filled at least as important a place in the
history of the country, will be explained largely by the fact that the
former were incidentally mentioned somewhere in the series, and
therefore had to be included, while the latter were not.

=Abnaki Indians.= A tribe of the Algonquian family, inhabiting a portion
of what is now the province of New Brunswick. They were early converts
of the French missionaries, and made common cause with the French
against the English colonists. A number were brought to Canada in the
seventeenth century, and formed a settlement on the St. Francis River, a
few miles above its junction with the St. Lawrence. The Indian town was

=Acadia.= The name Acadia or "la Cadie" is found as early as Nov. 8,
1603, in the commission of Henry IV appointing Pierre du Gua, Sieur de
Monts, lieutenant-general in La Cadie, extending from the fortieth to
the forty-sixth degree of north latitude. The limits were afterwards
reduced, and the boundaries of Acadia became a cause of contention
between France and England. France claimed that the English possessions
were restricted to the peninsula of Nova Scotia, and that the territory
now known as New Brunswick had not been ceded to England. The first
settlement in Acadia was on the Island of St. Croix in 1604, but the
following year it was transferred to Port Royal, and abandoned in 1607.
Three years later the Sieur de Poutrincourt established a new settlement
at Port Royal, which was destroyed by Argall in 1613. In September,
1621, James I granted the territory of Acadia, under the name of Nova
Scotia, to Sir William Alexander. This grant was renewed in July, 1625,
by Charles I. A small Scottish settlement was established at Port Royal
by the grantee. Acadia was restored to France by the treaty of St.
Germain-en-Laye in 1632, and during the same year new settlers were
brought from France. Acadia was finally ceded to Great Britain by the
treaty of Utrecht in 1713. =Index=: =Ch= Its resources and limits, 18;

=Acadia College.= Situated at Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Founded by the
Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society, 1838. Application made to the
Nova Scotia Assembly for incorporation as "The Trustees, Governors and
Fellows of the Queen's College." The corporation created with university
powers, 1840. At the next meeting of the Legislature its name changed to
Acadia College. Power of appointing governors transferred from the
Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces,
1851. Final changes in the Act of Incorporation, 1891. =Index=: =H=

=Acadians.= The first permanent settlers were those who came with De
Razilly in 1632, and from these the Acadians of to-day are descended.
Other French immigrants were brought by d'Aulnay de Charnisay from 1639
to 1649, and by La Tour and Le Borgne in 1651 and 1658 respectively.
There were also small immigrations at divers later dates. The first
general nominal census was taken in 1671, and gave a population of 392
souls. In 1686 there were 885 persons in Acadia. Seven years later the
inhabitants numbered 1018. When Acadia was ceded to Britain in 1713, the
Acadian population was 2500. Although from 1713 to 1745 a number of
families had escaped to the new French colonies of Isle Royale and Isle
St. Jean (now Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island), still in 1749, when
the British settled Halifax, there were about 12,500 Acadians in the
province. Another large influx of population to the same colonies, and
to the St. John River, took place between 1749 and 1755, yet there
remained in the latter year in the peninsula and in the Isthmus of
Chignecto some 10,000 inhabitants, of whom nearly 7000 were deported in
1755. The rest escaped to the woods; some went to Miramichi, and later
to Baie des Chaleurs; others crossed over to the Isles Royale and St.
Jean, and quite a number found their way to St. John River, and from
thence to the province of Quebec. The whole population of Acadians in
the peninsula, the Isthmus of Chignecto, the St. John River, Isle
Royale, and Isle St. Jean, at the time of the expulsion, is computed at
16,000. =Bib.=: Murdoch, _History of Nova Scotia_; Campbell, _History of
Nova Scotia_; Haliburton, _Historical and Statistical Account of Nova
Scotia_; Hannay, _History of Acadia_; Raymond, _St. John River_; Gaudet,

=Acadians, Expulsion of the.= Governor Lawrence in 1755, with the advice
of his Council and of Admirals Boscawen and Mostyn, but apparently
without consulting the home government, decided that the Acadians must
be deported from Nova Scotia. The reason for this decision was the
obstinate refusal of the Acadians to take the oath of allegiance, and
the conviction of the governor that the safety of the colony depended
upon their expulsion. In September, 1755, all preparations having been
made with the utmost secrecy, Monckton at Beauséjour, Winslow at Grand
Pré, Murray at Piziquid, and Handfield at Annapolis, seized the
inhabitants and held them prisoners until the arrival of the transport
and provision ships. These having been delayed, the final embarkation
did not take place until late in December. The Acadians were distributed
among the British colonies along the Atlantic seaboard. Some hired
vessels in 1763, and sailed to Miquelon, and in 1767 and following years
returned gradually to their old Acadian home. Others came directly to
Nova Scotia in 1766, there being no longer any reason for their
exclusion, while others went north to Quebec or south to Louisiana. The
present Acadian population in the three Maritime Provinces is over
150,000, and these are the descendants of the few families who escaped
deportation, and of those who returned from exile. =Index=: _See_

=Agriculture.= Societies for improving the conditions of agriculture
were founded in Nova Scotia, 1789; in Quebec the same year; and in Upper
Canada in 1792. Simcoe in Upper Canada and Dorchester in Quebec did much
to further agricultural interests, but Quebec owes most to J. F.
Perrault (_q.v._), and Nova Scotia to John Young (_q.v._). An
agricultural school was founded at Ste. Anne de la Pocatière in 1859;
the Guelph Agricultural College was established in 1874; the Nova
Scotia School of Agriculture, 1885; and the Macdonald College, at Ste.
Anne de Bellevue, opened in the fall of 1907. Agricultural Colleges are

=Alaska Boundary Question.= Arose out of differences of opinion as to
the interpretation of the 1828 Convention between Russia and Great

United States contention was that the boundary should follow a line
approximately parallel to the coast and thirty marine miles distant
therefrom; the Canadian, that it should follow the summit of the first
range, crossing many of the inlets near their mouths. The decision of
the Joint Commission of 1903 did not concede the United States claims in
full, but gave them an unbroken littoral, substantially what they had
contended for. =Index=: =D= Effect of Russian occupation, 38; early

1835. In 1853 his firm began building iron screw steamships, and their
first vessel, the _Canadian_, made its first voyage in 1855. The
following year, with a fleet of four vessels, a regular service was
opened between Canada and England, with fortnightly sailings. In 1859
the fleet was increased to eight steamers, and a weekly service opened.

the government, Murray refused to admit him to office. In April, 1768,
Carleton confirmed him in these appointments, which he retained until
superseded by George Pownall in 1775. From 1771 to 1776 deputy
commissary-general. One of the original members of the Legislative

=American Invasion= (1775-1776). Grew out of the belief entertained by
the rebellious colonists that the French of Canada could readily be won
to their side. As a matter of fact the latter, while for the most part
showing no enthusiasm to join Carleton's forces, were still less
inclined to coöperate with the invading army under Montgomery and
Arnold, or to support the movement for union with the New Englanders. On
the other hand, the Americans had a number of English-speaking
sympathizers in Montreal--men who had come there from the colonies to
the south. This, and its geographical position, made the capture of
Montreal an easy matter; but Quebec was a different problem. Here
Carleton gathered a small but efficient force of regulars and militia,
and successfully held the town against the invading army. Montgomery was
killed in the assault, Dec. 31, 1775, and in the spring of 1776 the
siege was raised. The invading army hastily retreated to Montreal, and
finally was driven out of the country. =Index=: =P= Joseph Papineau

=Archives.= Provision was made by the Parliament of Canada, in 1872, for

of a preliminary nature, but in 1884 the first of the important series
of calendars was included in the report. Abbé Verreau made a special
report on historical material in Europe bearing on Canadian history,
published in 1874. A report on manuscript material in the colonial
archives at Paris, by Edouard Richard, was published as a supplement to
the report for 1899. Dr. Brymner died in 1902, and Arthur G. Doughty was
appointed Dominion Archivist in 1904. The report for 1905, in 3 vols.,

publications, containing historical journals and other special material.

those incorporated by Parliament or royal charter from issuing notes. It
also provided for a deposit with the government to be held as a
guarantee; also for bank statistics. Further provisions designed to
place banking on a more secure footing were incorporated in the Act of
1871. Further banking legislation was passed in 1881 and in 1890.

=Bering Sea Question.= Arose out of a dispute as to the seal-fisheries
of Bering Sea. Several Canadian sealers were seized by the United States
in 1886, on the plea that these waters constituted a _mare clausum_, or
closed sea. Similar seizures were made in 1887 and 1889. Finally the
British and United States governments agreed to submit the question to
arbitration. The Commission met at Paris in 1893. Lord Hannen and Sir
John Thompson represented British interests; the United States was
represented by Judge Harlan and Senator Morgan. The other arbitrators
were Marquis Visconti Venosta of Italy, Gregora W. Gram of Sweden, and
Baron de Courcel of Belgium, who presided. The decision was in favour of
Great Britain, and contrary to the claim of the United States to
jurisdiction over the waters of the Bering Sea and the seals visiting
the coasts and islands of Alaska. Regulations were provided for the
better protection of the fisheries; and the United States was required
to compensate the Canadian sealers for the unlawful seizure of their
vessels. =Index=: =D= Influenced by Russian occupation, 38; settled

right of trading from one hostile port to another. =Index=: =Bk=

sailed with Masse for Mount Desert, with an expedition sent out by

to France and brought out his family to the new settlement. Accompanied
Champlain in his exploration of the Bay of Fundy. Jesuit missionaries
were sent out to Port Royal, whom Poutrincourt, although a good Roman
Catholic, found far from congenial. Their relations became more and more
strained, and when Poutrincourt sailed to France in 1613, the Jesuits
succeeded in having him thrown into prison. Regained his liberty and

office of intendant of New France, 1748. Sailed for Quebec and arrived

of the United States, is the provision that all matters not specifically
assigned to the provinces belong to the Dominion, the reverse being the
case under the United States Constitution. Broadly speaking, the Act
gives the Dominion exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of trade
and commerce, the postal service, customs and inland revenue, military
and naval service, navigation and shipping, currency and coinage,
banking, weights and measures, patents and copyrights, naturalization,
Indians. To the provinces it gives exclusive jurisdiction over direct

=Cabot, John.= Probably a native of Genoa. Became a citizen of Venice,
March 28, 1476, and at that time had been a resident of the city for
fifteen years. Went to England, and in 1497, under the direct authority
of Henry VII, sailed to the westward on a voyage of discovery. Landed on
the shores of America, but his exact landfall has been a moot point. It
is now generally believed that it was the easternmost cape of Cape
Breton. The following year sailed again, but there is no record that he
ever returned from this second voyage. =Bib.=: Beazley, _John and
Sebastian Cabot_; Dawson, _The Voyages of the Cabots_ (R. S. C., 1894,

North America_; Weare, _Cabot's Discovery of North America_; Ober. _John
and Sebastian Cabot_. =Cabot, Sebastian= (1477?-1557?). Son of John
Cabot. His share in the discovery of North America has been the subject
of much controversy. From having once been regarded as the sole
discoverer, it is now considered doubtful that he had anything to do
with the voyages of 1497 and 1498. He was in the service of Spain, and
also of England, receiving from Edward VI the title of Grand Pilot of
England. =Bib.=: Biddle, _Memoir of Sebastian Cabot_; Nicholls, _Life of

for South Africa from Quebec, Oct. 30, 1899, numbered 1141. The second

raised a contingent at his own expense. This contingent, known as
Strathcona's Horse, sailed from Halifax in March, 1900, the force
numbering 540 officers and men, and 599 horses. Over 3000 Canadians

operations in South Africa, the Canadians signally distinguished

when with the Gordon Highlanders and the Shropshires they led the final

are declared to be "the encouragement and general advancement of the
physical sciences, the arts and the manufactures," etc. Among the early
presidents were Sir W. E. Logan, Sir Henry Lefroy, Sir John Beverley
Robinson, George W. Allan, W. H. Draper, Sir Daniel Wilson, and Sir
Oliver Mowat. The publications of the Institute began with the _Canadian
Journal_, 1852, and have been continued, as _Proceedings, Transactions_,
etc., to the present time. =Bib.=: _The Canadian Journal_, 1852-1878;

another at Toronto, 1871; and the present periodical of the same name,
which dates from 1893. Of the earlier magazines, the _Literary Garland_
and the _Revue Canadienne_ alone lived for any considerable time, the
former having been published for over thirteen years, and the latter
still survives. =Bib.=: Hopkins, _Canada: An Ency._, vol. 5.

=Canadian Northern Railway.= The first link in this transcontinental
railway dates back to 1896, when construction was commenced on the line

1775, by Silas Deane of Connecticut, but was not actually undertaken
until 1831. The Welland Canal was commenced in 1824; and the Rideau

Lawrence. Continuing his voyage, passed the mouth of the Saguenay, and
landed on the Island of Orleans, which he named Île Bacchus. Brought his
little ships into the St. Charles River, upon whose banks stood the
Indian village of Stadaconé. After exploring the St. Lawrence as far as
the Indian town of Hochelaga (Montreal), returned to Stadaconé, where he
wintered. In the spring of 1536 sailed back to France, taking with him
the Iroquois chief, Donnacona. In 1541, made a third voyage to Canada.
Roberval was to have followed with a number of colonists, but did not
actually sail until the spring of 1542. When he reached Newfoundland, he
met Cartier on his way home. Roberval's colony proved disastrous, and
Cartier undertook a fourth voyage to the New World to rescue the
survivors. =Index=: =Ch= Names Hare Island, 13; ravages of scurvy among

=Champlain Lake.= Discovered by Samuel Champlain, July, 1609. Here took
place the first hostile encounter between the French and the Iroquois.
The French were the aggressors, and had bitter enough cause to remember
the fact throughout the century. In 1666 the Sieur de la Motte built a
fort on Île La Motte, which was afterwards abandoned. Fort St. Frederic
was built at Crown Point, 1731. It was enlarged and strengthened in
1734, and again in 1742. Lake Champlain became the war thoroughfare, not
merely between the Iroquois and French, but between New France and New
England. Fort Carillon was built, 1755-1756. With this lake are
associated the names of Dieskau and Sir William Johnson, Montcalm and
Abercrombie, Ethan Allen and Montgomery. =Index=: =F= Champlain reaches,

subdivided into nine. The see of Rupert's Land, founded 1849, was
subsequently divided into Rupert's Land, Moosonee, Saskatchewan,
Calgary, Mackenzie River, Qu'Appelle, Athabaska, Keewatin, and Selkirk.
In 1859 was established the see of British Columbia, divided later into
New Westminster and Caledonia. In 1857 the Church of England Synod was

settlement, missionaries, etc., 1621. Absorbed Champlain's Company,
1622, and the united Companies carried on trade until 1633. =Index=:

=Company of New France (Compagnie des Cent-Associés).= Established,
1627, by Cardinal Richelieu, on the advice of Isaac de Razilly. A
monopoly of fifteen years was granted, with full ownership of the entire
valley of the St. Lawrence, in return for which the Company was to take
out three hundred colonists every year up to 1643. No serious effort was
made to carry out this obligation, although the Company continued to
enjoy its monopoly until 1663. =Index=: =L= Resigns its charter, 41;

Sulpice, in 1663, 108, 135; its debts discharged by De Belmont, 135.

=Company of Rouen and St. Malo (Champlain's Company).= Established at
the instance of Champlain, in 1614. The shares were divided among the
merchants of Rouen and St. Malo. The terms of their charter required the
Company to bring out colonists, but as usual they did not take this
obligation very seriously. They did, however, make one notable addition
to the population of New France, for in the spring of 1617 they brought
out Louis Hébert and his family. Hébert's experience as a colonist was
not such as to encourage others to follow his example. The Company's
monopoly was cancelled in 1620. =Index=: =Ch= Formed by Champlain, 122;

=Company of the West Indies (Compagnie des Indes Occidentales).=
Chartered by Louis XIV, 1664, following the cancellation of the charter
of the Company of New France. Its field of operations was enormous,
covering the west coast of Africa, the east coast of South America from
the Amazon to the Orinoco, Canada, Acadia, and Newfoundland. The
Christianization of the native tribes was given as the principal object
of the Company, commerce being of only secondary importance. Despite its
many privileges, and the readiness with which its stock was subscribed,
it did not prosper, and by 1672 was hopelessly in debt. Three years
later its charter was revoked, so far as Canada was concerned. =Index=:

=Confederation.= The first definite step in the movement looking towards
the union of the British North American colonies, was the Charlottetown
Conference, 1864. Delegates from the three Maritime Provinces met to
consider the union of those provinces. At the Conference, delegates from
Canada (constituting what are now the provinces of Ontario and Quebec)
appeared, and urged the broadening of the discussion to cover all the
provinces. Out of this meeting grew the Quebec Conference, of the same
year, attended by delegates from Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland; the two latter subsequently
withdrew from the movement. The Quebec Conference drew up a series of
resolutions, which were made the basis of the final legislation. In 1866
delegates from the provinces met at the Westminster Hotel in London, and
framed the British North America Act. The Act was passed by the Imperial
Parliament, and received the queen's assent, March, 1867. It was
proclaimed throughout the new Dominion of Canada, July 1, 1867. Manitoba
was created a province, July 15, 1870. British Columbia joined the
union, July 20, 1871; and Prince Edward Island, July 1, 1873. The
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created Sept. 1, 1905.

Rebellion of 1837 acted as aide-de-camp to the lieutenant-governor. In
March, 1837, became solicitor-general, and in 1840 promoted to office of
attorney-general. After the union of the provinces retained in the
Executive Council as attorney-general of Upper Canada. It fell to his
lot to pilot the ministry through the stormy debates of the first
session, and to resist the attacks of Baldwin, Hincks, and their
fellow-Reformers. In September, 1842, saw the necessity of resigning and
gave way in order that the La Fontaine-Baldwin ministry might be formed.

opposition. On the resignation of the La Fontaine-Baldwin ministry in
December, 1843, accepted office with Viger, and in the exciting election
held in the autumn of 1844 obtained a bare majority for the new
ministry. In January, 1845, resigned his seat in the Legislative Council
and elected to the Assembly for London. An unsuccessful attempt to
secure the support of the French-Canadian Reform section discredited him
with the Tories of Upper Canada, and in May, 1847, withdrew from the
Cabinet, and shortly afterwards resigned his seat in the Assembly.

=Duquesne de Menneville, Michel Ange, Marquis de.= Appointed governor of
New France 1752, in succession to La Jonquière. His policy was to
intercept communication between New England and the western Indians and
thus to restore the Indians to dependence on France. In the spring of
1753 sent a force of a thousand men under Morin to the Ohio district; a
fort was built at Presque Isle and another, Fort Le Boeuf, inland on
River Le Boeuf. Disease made ravages among the troops, and while 300
were left to garrison the forts, the remainder were compelled to return
to Montreal, and Duquesne's plans for a further advance were frustrated.
Nevertheless the Indians were brought into submission to the French.
Improved the organization of the government of the colony, and through
thorough discipline raised the efficiency of the colonial troops.

Petersburg on special mission, 1833. Ambassador to Russia, 1836. Sent to
Canada in 1838 to bring order out of the chaos of the Rebellion. His
famous Report followed. His policy in Canada excited much opposition
both in Great Britain and Canada. The House of Lords voted disapproval
of some of his acts, and he took the extraordinary step of returning to
England without either being recalled or obtaining the royal consent.
Nevertheless the wisdom of his recommendations has since been abundantly
justified. Died at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, soon after his return.

=Fenian Raids.= The Fenian Brotherhood is said to have been formed about
1858 in Ireland and the United States, the object being to liberate
Ireland from its connection with England, and establish a republic. A
history of the movement in Ireland will be found in McCarthy's _History
of our Own Times_, and in O'Leary's _Recollections of Fenianism_. Early
in 1866 the American branch of the Brotherhood planned an invasion of
Canada. The Canadian militia was called out, but the invasion was
postponed. In April, the New Brunswick border was threatened, and troops
marched to the defence of St. Andrews and St. Stephen. The Fenians
thought better of it. Late in May another party, under one O'Neil,
crossed from Buffalo to Fort Erie and advanced to Ridgeway, where they
were driven back. In 1870 the same O'Neil led his followers into Quebec,
but was again repulsed. In 1871 he made a similar attempt in the West,
but a detachment of United States troops from Fort Pembina followed,
arrested him, and dispersed his followers. An aftermath of the earlier
Fenian Raids was the murder of Thomas D'Arcy McGee (_q.v._) in Ottawa,
1868. =Index=: =Md= Claims for damages, 166-167; claims withdrawn,

1817, and settled at Kingston. Becoming convinced of the need of radical
changes in the land system of Upper Canada, attacked the administration
with so much energy that he was finally, after a grossly unfair trial,
expelled from the province. Returning to Scotland, devoted himself to
the preparation of his work on Upper Canada; lost most of his property
as the result of lawsuits; and imprisoned for a personal attack on Lord
Brougham in the lobby of the House of Commons. On his release, visited
the United States about 1836, and instrumental in dissuading Ohio
sympathizers from joining the movement under William Lyon Mackenzie. In
1842 his case brought before the Legislature of Upper Canada, and the
House decided that his arrest had been "illegal, unconstitutional and
without possibility of excuse and palliation, and the sentence declared
null and void." Did not, however, return to Canada until 1856, when he
was granted a pension of fifty pounds; this he refused because he
considered that his vindication had not been complete. Contested Oxford
County in 1860, but defeated; returned to Edinburgh, where he died.

=Hudson's Bay Company.= Organized by a number of English gentlemen, who
sent out a trading expedition to Hudson Bay, in the _Nonsuch_, in 1668.
This initial venture proved so successful that two other ships were sent
out in 1670; and the same year King Charles granted a charter
incorporating them as "The Governor and Company of Adventurers of
England trading into Hudson's Bay." For many years the operations of the
Company were confined to the shores of Hudson Bay, but the pressure of
competition eventually forced them inland, and at the height of their
power they had established trading-posts from Labrador to the Pacific,
and from California almost to the Arctic. In 1821, the rival North West
Company (_q.v._) was absorbed; and in 1869 the company surrendered to

=Île à la Crosse.= Lake and trading-post. The lake is on the upper
waters of the Churchill River, in about long. 108°. Its name is derived
from the Indian game of lacrosse, which was very popular there. The
first trading-post was built on a peninsula on the western side of the
lake by Thomas Frobisher in 1776. Other forts were built there later by
the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company, the lake being a
strategic point in the western fur trade.

=Illinois Indians.= Of Algonquian stock. First mentioned in the Jesuit
_Relation_ of 1660 as living south-west of Green Bay. They ranged
throughout the country between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi, and
down the west bank of that river as far as the Des Moines; and have been
described by Allouez, Marquette, Hennepin, Rasles, and other early
French explorers. Harassed on one side by the Sioux and Foxes, and on
the other by the Iroquois, their numbers were reduced from six or eight
thousand, at the end of the seventeenth century, to less than two
thousand about 1750. The murder of Pontiac by one of their warriors
brought upon them a war of extermination. To-day only a handful remain,
in Oklahoma. =Index=: =F= Allies of the French against the Iroquois,

=Imperial Conference.= Held in London, 1887. Canada was represented by
Sir Alexander Campbell and Sandford Fleming. Among the questions
discussed were those of inter-Imperial defence and trade, the Pacific
cable, etc. Another conference was held in Ottawa in 1894 (_see_
Colonial Conference, 1894); and another in London in June, 1896, Canada
being represented by Sir Mackenzie Bowell and Sandford Fleming. At an
adjourned meeting in October, 1896, Sir Donald Smith and Hon. A.G. Jones
represented the Dominion, Mr. Fleming being present in an advisory
capacity. On the occasion of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, 1897,
another conference was held in London, Joseph Chamberlain presiding, and
the self-governing colonies being represented by their premiers. Again,
in 1902, the colonial premiers met in London, under the presidency of
Joseph Chamberlain. The London Conference of 1907, presided over by Lord
Elgin, discussed various Imperial questions, but was chiefly memorable
because of the decision to hold similar meetings every four years, and
to provide a permanent bureau at London devoted specifically to the
interests of the Empire.

=Imperial Federation.= Advocated by Thomas Pownall, governor of
Massachusetts Bay, in 1764. He proposed a scheme by which "Great Britain
may be no more considered as the Kingdom of this Isle alone, with many
appendages of provinces, colonies, settlements, and other extraneous
parts, but as a grand marine dominion, consisting of our possessions in
the Atlantic and in America united into one Empire." Subsequently
proposed by Joseph Howe, in 1855, and again in 1863; also by Thomas
Chandler Haliburton and other Canadian statesmen and writers. =Index=:

in May, 1885. A conference to the same end had been held in London, in
July, 1884. The league in Canada changed its name, in 1896, to the
British Empire League in Canada, at the suggestion of Sir Charles
Tupper. _See_ Denison.

taught school in Pennsylvania for a time, and then took holy orders. In
1764 became assistant to Dr. Auchmuty, rector of Trinity Church, New
York, and in 1777 succeeded him as rector. His sympathies being with the
mother country, removed to Nova Scotia after the Revolution, and thence
to England. First bishop of Nova Scotia, with jurisdiction over
practically all British North America, 1787. One of the notable events
of his episcopate was his establishment of King's College, Windsor. In
1793 his huge diocese divided by the creation of the diocese of Quebec,
of which Jacob Mountain (_q.v._) became first bishop. =Index=: =Dr=

members most of the leaders of the more progressive and independent
element in Quebec political life, among them A. A. Dorion, Eric Dorion,
Joseph Doutre, Rodolphe Laflamme, and Wilfrid Laurier. The success of
the parent society led to the founding of similar Instituts throughout
the province. Although popular among the laity, these societies
encountered the determined opposition of the Roman Catholic Church, led
by Bishop Bourget of Montreal. The outside societies yielded to clerical
pressure, but the Montreal Institut stood upon its rights. The fight
went on for many years, but finally most of the Roman Catholic members
dropped out, and the books and papers were transferred to the Fraser
Institute. =Bib.=: Willison, _Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberal
Party_.

=Intendant.= An office created originally by Richelieu, in France, and
transferred to New France. The first intendant of Canada was Robert,
appointed in 1663, who was succeeded two years later by the ablest
occupant of the office, Jean Talon. The intendant was charged with the
supervision of practically all the civil affairs of the colony,
including the administration of justice, but his most important
function, from the point of view of the court, was to act as a virtual
spy upon the acts of the governor. Inevitably, harmony was impossible
between these two officials, and the history of New France is punctuated
with their perpetual quarrels. =Index=: =F= Jean Talon appointed as, 51;

=Intercolonial Railway.= Surveys proposed by the government of Canada in
1863. Three engineers were to be appointed, one by the Imperial
government, one by Canada, and one by the Maritime Provinces. They all
nominated the same man, Sandford Fleming, by whom the surveys were
accordingly carried out. The railway was made a condition of the union
of the Maritime Provinces with Canada, and the work of construction was
pushed forward, the line being formally opened July 1, 1876. In 1871 the
Prince Edward Island Railway was begun, and in 1873 it became a portion
of the Intercolonial system. Other extensions and branches were built or
acquired, the line finally running from Sydney and Halifax to Montreal.

=Iroquois.= A confederation of tribes, at first five, the Cayuga,
Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca, to which the Tuscarora was added
after 1726, as well as the remnants of many other tribes. They were
known to the English colonists as the Five Nations, and later as the Six
Nations. They called themselves _Oñgwanonsioñni_, "we are of the
extended lodge." When they first came into contact with Europeans, they
occupied the country between Lake Champlain and the Genesee River, and
this remained their home territory, but they ranged far and wide,
carrying their conquering raids eastwards to the Kennebec, westwards to
Lake Michigan, north to the Hudson Bay watershed, and south to the
Tennessee. They numbered about 16,000 in 1677, and after dropping to
10,000 in the next century, they returned to their original strength at
the opening of the twentieth century. About two-thirds are on
reservations in Canada; the remainder in New York. =Index=: =F=

Territories. Also known at one time as New Britain. The name is properly
applied to the strip of coast from Cape Chidley to Blanc Sablon, forming
a dependency of the colony of Newfoundland. On various theories as to
origin of name, _see_ Ganong, _Cartography of Gulf of St. Lawrence_ (R.
S. C., 1889). The boundaries have long been in dispute between
Newfoundland and Canada, and the territory has several times changed
hands. The Labrador coast was first discovered by the Northmen, in the
tenth century. Cabot sailed along the coast in 1498, and Corte-Real in
1500. The interior remained practically unexplored till traversed by
officers of the Hudson's Bay Company about 1840. There are a few posts
of the Hudson's Bay Company on the coast. The southern portion is
inhabited by a primitive race of fishermen; in the north are several
missions of the Moravian Brethren, first established there in 1764.

_Travels_, "full of keen, fair-minded observation regarding every
variety of detail of life in America as this exiled French nobleman
found it, told in a readable style, not without an occasional touch of
humour." Exiled from France in 1768; returned, for several years, and
went into retirement until after Waterloo. Made a peer of France at the
Restoration. =Index=: =Dr= Not allowed to visit Lower Canada, 290. =S=

Canada in the spring of 1666; granted by the Sulpicians the seigniory of
Lachine, from which, in 1669, he set out with Dollier de Casson and
Galinée upon the first of those explorations towards the west and south
for which he was to become famous. Meeting Jolliet at the western end of
Lake Ontario, Dollier de Casson and Galinée decided to make their way to
the upper lakes, while La Salle turned south and explored the Ohio. His
later explorations have been the subject of long controversy--the point
in dispute being whether he explored the Mississippi before or after
Marquette and Jolliet. In any event, he first descended the river to its
mouth, 1681-1682. Upon his return, sailed for France, and in 1684 set
out with four ships to establish a colony at the mouth of the
Mississippi. This unfortunate expedition culminated in the murder of La
Salle by his own men. =Index=: =F= Sent to invite Indians to conference,

=La Tour, Charles Amador de.= Son of Claude de la Tour. Came to Acadia
in 1610 with his father. Driven out of Port Royal by the English; built
a post near Cape Sable, on what is now known as Port Latour. In 1632,
when Acadia was restored to France, Razilly came out with Charnisay to
strengthen the colony. Razilly died in 1636, and a bitter conflict
followed between Charnisay and La Tour, both of whom claimed to
represent the king in Acadia. Charnisay had rebuilt Port Royal, and La
Tour occupied a fort at the mouth of the St. John. The outcome of the
quarrel was an order for the arrest of La Tour. Charnisay attacked La
Tour's fort, but was driven off. When he blockaded the harbour, La Tour
escaped to Boston, returned with English ships, and drove Charnisay to
the shelter of Port Royal. The latter's opportunity came, however,
later. He attacked the fort during La Tour's absence. La Tour's wife
made a gallant defence, and Charnisay succeeded in the end only by
resorting to treachery. He carried Madame La Tour to Port Royal, where
she died in 1645. Some years later, after the death of Charnisay, La
Tour brought this curious drama to a conclusion by marrying the widow of
his rival. He had already obtained restitution from the king, who made
him governor of Acadia; and some years later showed his powers of
persuasion by obtaining a generous grant of land from Cromwell, who had,
in 1654, taken possession of the colony. Died about 1666. =Bib.=:

for France in 1627, and on his return the following year, with supplies
for the defence of Acadia, captured by Kirke and carried to England.
There married one of the queen's French maids of honour, and was
persuaded to throw in his lot with the English. Promised to win over his
son Charles (_q.v._), but the latter scornfully refused to change his
allegiance. Afterwards built a fort at the mouth of the St. John, for
the French, to whom he had once more transferred his services. =Index=:

his position as president of the Company of New France, and had used his
office to acquire the island of Montreal and Point Lévis opposite
Quebec. His administration as governor made odious not only by a long

Newfoundland. In 1707 with the army in Flanders, and wounded at
Malplaquet in 1709. Returning to Canada, engaged in the fur trade, for
some years on the St. Maurice, and 1727-1728 on Lake Nipigon. There
conceived the idea of exploring the unknown country beyond Lake
Superior, to discover the Western Sea, a project to which he devoted the
remainder of his life. Left Montreal for the West in 1731; built forts
on Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods, and in the succeeding years
penetrated to Lake Winnipeg, Red River, and the Assiniboine. In 1738
made a journey to the Mandan villages on the Missouri; and the following
year one of his sons penetrated to the Saskatchewan. In 1742, unable to
go himself, sent two of his sons far to the south-west. They hoped, as
he had always hoped, to reach at last the Western Sea, but were baffled
by hostile tribes and the barrier of the Rocky Mountains. In 1743
returned finally to Montreal, broken in health and heavily in debt. Six
years later died there. His sons begged to be allowed to continue his
western explorations, but hostile influences made this impossible. =WM=

=Maisonneuve, Paul de Chomedy, Sieur de.= In this "devout and valiant
gentleman," as Parkman says, lived again the spirit of Godfrey de
Bouillon, leader of the first Crusade. He had seen much service in
European wars, before the opportunity came to consecrate his sword to
the church in Canada. A group of enthusiasts in France had obtained a
grant of the Island of Montreal from Lauson and the Company of New
France, and purposed to establish there a religious colony, of which
Maisonneuve was appointed governor. Sailed from Rochelle, in 1641, with
a company of soldiers and artisans; wintered at Quebec; and on the
eighteenth of May, 1642, landed on the same spot where Champlain had
stood thirty-one years before. Here he and his men set to work to build
a chapel, fort, and their simple habitations, thereby laying the
foundation of the future city of Montreal. Was for 22 years governor of
Montreal, but through the jealousy of De Mésy, governor-general of
Canada, was recalled to France by De Tracy in 1664. Though no charges
were made against him he found no possibility of reinstatement in office
and resigned in 1669; died in 1676. =Index=: =F= Conducts mission colony

Episcopal Church united with the British Wesleyans. In 1874 the Wesleyan
Methodist Conference of Canada, the Canadian Wesleyan New Connexion

Norman McLeod, formed a partnership with Peter Pond and Peter Pangman,
western fur traders. Alexander Mackenzie joined the Company, and much of
its success was due to his energy and resourcefulness. His cousin,
Roderick Mackenzie, was also in its service. Keen rivalry resulted
between the two companies, finally culminating in a tragedy; in the
Athabaska department, Pond, who had deserted to the North West Company,
quarrelled with his rival, Ross, and in the scuffle Ross was fatally
shot. This serious news being brought down to the headquarters at Grand
Portage, a conference was held, resulting in the union of the Companies
in 1788. =Bib.=: Bryce, _Hudson's Bay Company_; Willson, _The Great

was governed by the so-called "Fishing Admirals," the most famous of
whom was Richard Whitbourne, author of _A Discourse and Discoverie of
Newfoundland_. French influence on the island dated from the founding of
Placentia in 1660. In 1696 Iberville captured St. John's, and laid waste
the coast settlements. St. John's was again captured by a French
squadron, in 1760. A Legislative Assembly was granted to the colony in
1832 as a result of popular agitation; and responsible government
established in 1855. Efforts to bring about the union of the island with
Canada were made in 1864, and again in 1895, but without success.

the North West Company that the project be undertaken jointly, but the
Company declining the offer, he induced several of its partners and
employees to join him. These men sailed to the Columbia by way of Cape
Horn, while another party went overland by the route followed by Lewis

Cabot, and again to Cartier, but without sufficient proof. It bore that
name until the year 1798, when the present form was adopted, in honour
of the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. During the French régime,
it was largely settled by Acadian families, but these were expelled
after the island came under British rule. In 1769 the island was granted
to a number of proprietors, and settlement was very slow. It formed part
of Nova Scotia until 1769, when it was made a separate province.
Responsible government was granted in 1851; and in 1873 the province
entered Confederation. =Index=: =E= Land question in, 143-144; 174-175.

and south sides, and 317 on the east and west; and is said to have been
designed by English military engineers. The walls are still standing,

still on the walls. _See_ Tyrrell's Introduction to Hearne's _Journey_
(Champlain Society ed., 1910). Hearne was governor of the fort in 1782,
when it was captured by the French under Admiral La Perouse. The fort
was built on Eskimo Point, just west of the mouth of the river. The
present Hudson's Bay Company post stands on the site of a much earlier
fort, built by the Company in 1688. =Bib.=: Bryce, _Hudson's Bay

=Quebec City.= Founded by Champlain (_q.v._), in 1608. Seventy-three
years earlier, Jacques Cartier had sailed up the great river, and landed
near the same spot, wintering in a creek not far from the native town of
Stadaconé. Champlain, in 1608, built a rude fort, the _Abitation de
Québec_, and a warehouse. There he and his men spent the winter, but
before succour arrived in the spring, most Of them died of scurvy. Had a
man of less courage and resourcefulness been in Command, the infant
settlement of Quebec might have died a natural death. Champlain kept it
alive, and, though harassed by enemies, and neglected by the motherland,
the town grew steadily from the year of its birth. Quebec has passed
through five sieges, that of Kirke in 1629, that of Phipps, 1690, the
great siege of 1759, Lévis's siege of 1760, and that of Montgomery and
Arnold, 1775-1776. =Index=: =Bk= The centre of society in Canada, 46;

=Quebec Library=. Founded at Quebec in 1779. The first public library in
what is now Canada. On Jan. 7 of that year, the following advertisement
appeared in the Quebec _Gazette_: "A subscription has been commenced for
establishing a publick library for the city and district of Quebec. It
has met with the approbation of His Excellency the Governor and of the
Bishop, and it is hoped that the institution, so particularly useful in
this country, will be generally encouraged." The idea of the library
originated with Governor Haldimand, and the first lot of books was
purchased in England, under his instructions, by Richard Cumberland, the
dramatist. An Act of incorporation obtained in 1840. Five years later,
the library was absorbed by the Quebec Library Association, founded
1843; and in 1866 the Association dissolved and sold its books to the
Quebec Literary and Historical Society (_q.v._). =Bib.=: A detailed
account of the Quebec Library, and the Quebec Library Association, will
be found in Würtele's paper, in Quebec Lit. and Hist. Soc. _Trans._,
1887-1889.

=Quebec Literary and Historical Society=. Founded at Quebec in 1824,
largely through the influence and liberality of the Earl of Dalhousie,
then governor-general. Its purposes were "to discover and rescue from
the unsparing hand of time the records which yet remain of the earliest
history of Canada. To preserve while in our power, such documents as may
be found amid the dust of yet unexplored depositories, and which may
prove important to general history and to the particular history of this
province." In 1829, another similar organization was absorbed; and in
1831 the society was incorporated by Act of Parliament. The library had
been started the previous year, as well as the museum. Both have grown
steadily, despite serious losses from fires. =Bib.=: The publications
consist of _Transactions_ and _Historical Documents_. The first volume
of the former appeared in 1829, and the first part of the latter in
1838. The _Trans._, for 1887-1889 contain an account of the Society, its
publications and its library, by F. C. Würtele, who also published in
1891 an Index to the series of publications.

=Quebec, Province of=. Area 351,873 square miles. Formed the principal
part of Canada, as ceded to Britain in 1763. Under the Quebec Act, 1774,
its boundaries extended west to the Ohio and Mississippi. In 1791, the
province was divided into Upper and Lower Canada, with the Ottawa River
as the boundary; in 1841 the two provinces were again united; and in
1867, Quebec became a province of the Dominion. The period of military
rule extended from the conquest to 1764, when civil government was
established. In 1775 the first Legislative Council met at Quebec.
Constitutional government was established in 1791; and responsible
government in 1841. =Index=: =Dr= Government of, embraced Canada, 7. =S=

=Quebec, Siege of, 1629.= The previous year, David Kirke had sailed up
the river, and sent a demand for the surrender of the fort, which
Champlain peremptorily refused. Kirke thereupon returned to the gulf to
meet the French fleet under De Roquemont, which he captured after a
battle which lasted fifteen hours, and carried his prizes and prisoners
back to England. The following year he returned, with a fleet of three
sails, and Champlain surrendered the fort, the more readily as the
little garrison was at the point of starvation. =Index=: _See_ Quebec
City; Kirke. =Bib.=: Kirke, _The First English Conquest of Canada_;

=Quebec, Siege of, 1690.= Sir William Phipps, having captured Port Royal
in May of this year, appeared before Quebec in October, with thirty-two
ships and a force of over two thousand men. He immediately summoned
Frontenac to surrender, and got a contemptuous refusal. Quebec was well
defended both in men and guns, and after a fruitless attack on the town
from the Beauport flats, and a subsequent bombardment in which he did
much less damage to the town than his ships suffered from Frontenac's
batteries, Phipps abandoned the siege. A little church then building in
the Lower Town was named _Notre Dame de la Victoire_, to commemorate the
victory. =Index=: _See_ Quebec city; Phipps. =Bib.=: Myrand, _Sir
William Phipps devant Québec_; Parkman, _Frontenac_.

=Quebec, Siege of, 1759.= Following the capture of Louisbourg, Duquesne,
and Fort Frontenac, in the campaign of 1758, two expeditions were sent
the following year against Quebec, one by land under Amherst, the second
by water under Wolfe and Saunders. The French forces were commanded by
Montcalm, whose plans were hampered at every stage by the interference
of the governor, Vaudreuil. Wolfe commanded the attacking army, and
Saunders the fleet. The former had as brigadiers Townshend, Monckton,
and Murray. Montcalm had a force of over fourteen thousand men, partly
regulars and partly militia. Wolfe's army numbered less than nine
thousand men, but all were regulars. After bombarding the city from the
Lévis shore, Wolfe, on July 31, made an unsuccessful attack at
Montmorency. Several ineffective efforts followed, and it was not until
early in September that Wolfe matured the plans which led to ultimate
success. Landing his men at a cove two miles above the city, on the
night of the twelfth, he had three thousand men upon the heights of
Abraham before daybreak. Montcalm hastily assembled his troops and led
them to the attack, but was completely defeated. During the battle, both
Wolfe and Montcalm were mortally wounded, and five of the French
brigadiers fell upon the field. The French were pursued to the gates of
the city, and Townshend, who had succeeded to the command, had
difficulty in re-forming his troops to repel an attack from the rear by
Bougainville. The latter, however, after a brief engagement, was forced
to retire; and the British remained masters of the field. Five days
later, the city capitulated to Saunders and Townshend. =Index=: _See_

=Quebec, Siege of, 1760.= After the battle of Ste. Foy, April 20, 1760,
Murray retreated within the walls of Quebec, and Lévis laid siege to the
town. The defences were in a feeble state, but Murray strengthened them
by forming a wall of ice. In May a British fleet appeared, and Lévis,
seeing that the cause was lost, hastily raised the siege. =Bib.=:

Thomas Liddell; succeeded by Dr. John Machar, Dr. John Cook, Dr. Leitch,
Dr. Snodgrass. In 1877 Dr. George Monro Grant became principal, and it
was due mainly to his enthusiasm and splendid organizing ability that
the university reached its present high state of efficiency. On the
death of Dr. Grant, in 1902, he was succeeded by Dr. D.M. Gordon.

British forces, consisting of regulars and militia, between 1500 and
2000 men, scattered along the Niagara River from Fort Erie to Fort
George. The opposing American forces numbered about 6000 men, similarly
distributed on the south bank of the river, under Stephen Van
Rensselaer. In the first skirmish, a few hundred men only were engaged
on either side, and the Americans finally gained the heights, brought up
reinforcements, and remained in possession for several hours. The
British losses included Brock and Macdonell. Sheaffe, on whom the
command had devolved, gathered together the scattered detachments of
British troops, 1000 strong, and marching them through the woods,
attacked the Americans from the inland side, and completely defeated
them. Many were driven over the banks into the river, and between 900
and 1000 surrendered, including Major-General Wadsworth and
Lieutenant-Colonel Winfield Scott. =Index=: =Bk= Account of battle,

of the North." About 1783, permanent settlements on the shores of the
bay were made by United Empire Loyalists and disbanded officers and men
of regiments serving in Canada. About the same time a number of Mohawks

in 1651, and settled at Three Rivers. In 1652 captured by the Iroquois
and carried off to their country, where by great good fortune he escaped
the following year. In 1657 had the hardihood to make a voluntary visit
to the Onondagas; in 1658 explored the country south-west of Lake
Superior, discovered the Mississippi, and possibly went beyond. In 1661
made another journey to the west, accompanied as on the previous journey
by his brother-in-law, Medard Chouart; wintered among the Sioux, and the
following year explored the country north of Lake Superior, and
apparently penetrated to James Bay. In 1665 went to England and offered
his services to lead a trading expedition to Hudson Bay. The result of
this trading venture was the establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company.
In 1674, returned to the service of France, led an expedition to Hudson
Bay in 1682, and captured an English ship. In 1684 once more changed his
allegiance, and from that year to the time of his death remained in the
service of the Hudson's Bay Company. =Index=: =F= Proceedings of, in

=Rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada.= The culmination of a long
agitation, on the part of the French-Canadians, for a larger measure of
popular government. The older and more experienced of their leaders
refused to overstep the bounds of constitutional agitation; but
Papineau, Wolfred Nelson, and a few more hot-headed enthusiasts
determined to resort to armed rebellion. A series of violent speeches
and demonstrations, in the summer and autumn of 1837, in which Papineau
was the central figure, led to incipient riots in Montreal and
elsewhere, and the decision of the authorities to arrest Papineau blew
the smouldering embers into a fierce blaze. Nelson and Brown gathered
their followers together at St. Denis and St. Charles on the Richelieu,
and Colonel Gore and Colonel Wetherall were sent to disperse them.
Shortly after, Amury Girod raised the flag of revolt at St. Eustache,
and Sir John Colborne led a force against him. In every case the rebels
were dispersed. Papineau, Nelson, Brown, and the other leaders fled.
Papineau and Brown escaped over the border. The others were captured and
exiled to Bermuda. The next year Robert Nelson and Dr. Côte made a final
attempt at Napierville. Nelson managed to escape, but his misguided
followers were captured, twelve executed, and eighty-seven transported
to Australia. =Index=: =C= Responsibility of the government for, 2;

=Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada.= Almost the exact counterpart of the
revolt in the lower province. The leaders here were William Lyon
Mackenzie, Samuel Lount, Van Egmond, and Rolph. The plan was to march
upon Toronto, seize the city, and proclaim a republic. This was early in
December. On the night of the 5th, the insurgents marched on the city,
were met on the outskirts by a small body of Loyalists, and
ignominiously fled. The following day, having gained reinforcements,
they made a stand at Montgomery's tavern, and were completely routed by
the militia under MacNab. Mackenzie, Lount, and Rolph made their escape.
Lount was afterwards captured, tried, and hanged. Spasmodic efforts were
made in this and the following years, with the aid of American
sympathizers, to keep the Rebellion alive, but the movement had no
serious support in Canada, and in every case ended in disaster to the
rebels. =Index=: =Mc= Excuses for, 12; history of, 12-13; _Globe_

=Reciprocity.= Efforts were made from time to time by Canada, between
the years 1847 and 1854, to secure the free admission of goods between
Canada and the United States, but without success until the latter year,
when Lord Elgin negotiated a treaty. It came into force in 1855, and was
abrogated in 1866, at the instance of the United States. The renewal of
the treaty was urged by Canada in 1866, 1869, 1871, 1874, 1879, 1887,
1892, and 1896, but in every instance the American authorities failed to

=Récollets.= A branch of the Franciscan order. First came to Canada in
1615, at the request of Champlain, and under the authority of Pope Paul
V. The same year they built a convent at Quebec. Of the four members of
the order who came out in 1615, Le Caron was assigned to the Huron
mission; Dolbeau to the Montagnais; and Jamay and Du Plessis remained at
Quebec. Among later members of the order, Sagard and Le Clerc became
famous as the historians of their missions in New France. =Index=: =F=

=Red River.= Sometimes called Red River of the North, to distinguish it
from the Red River of Texas. The name is supposed to have been derived
from the colour of its waters, heavily impregnated with clay. It was
discovered by La Vérendrye in 1733, and explored as far as the mouth of
the Assiniboine in that year. The river rises in North Dakota, and
enters Lake Winnipeg after a course of 545 miles. =Bib.=: Lovell,

=Red River Colony.= Also known as the Red River Settlement; Selkirk
Colony; Assiniboia, etc. Founded by the Earl of Selkirk (_q.v._), in
1811. The first party of colonists from Scotland reached York Factory
that year, under the leadership of Miles Macdonell, and arrived at the
Red River in 1812. A second party was sent out in 1812, reaching Red
River in 1813. In that same year a third party sailed from the Orkneys,
reaching their destination in 1814; and in 1815 a still larger party, in
charge of Robert Semple, sailed for Hudson Bay and reached Red River the
same year. The colonists suffered great privations for the first few
years, and were constantly harassed by the fur traders of the North West
Company. This petty warfare culminated in the Seven Oaks affair, in
which Governor Semple lost his life. After the union of the two fur
Companies, in 1821, the colony entered upon a period of comparative
peace and prosperity; and eventually became, in 1870, part of the
province of Manitoba. =Index=: =MS= The settlers sail from Stornoway, in

member from 1864 to his death. Besides many minor donations to the
University, gave $20,000 in 1871 to found a chair of mathematics,
$140,000 for a museum in 1881, and $135,000 for a library building,
besides an endowment of $100,000 for the library fund, and $30,000 for
the museum fund. Removed to England in 1880, where he made his home in

for responsible government, from its very nature, cannot be limited to
an exact period. It was a gradual growth, whose roots ran back almost to
the beginning of the period of British rule in Canada. The Quebec Act of
1774, the Constitutional Act of 1791, the Ninety-Two Resolutions of
1834, the Rebellion of 1837, and Durham's Report, were mile-stones on
the road to responsible government. =Index=: =Mc= Rattray on, 5, 6; Lord

=Riel Rebellion=, 1869-1870. The territorial rights of the Hudson's Bay
Company having been transferred to Canada, a surveying party under
Colonel Dennis was sent out to Red River in 1869, and the same year
William Macdougall was appointed lieutenant-governor of Rupert's Land,
and instructed to proceed to Fort Garry and assume control. The French
half-breeds, alarmed at these proceedings, which they thought menaced
the rights to their lands, turned back the surveying parties, and
prevented Macdougall from crossing the boundary. They formed themselves
into a provisional government, of which Louis Riel was secretary, and
later was elected president. Riel published a "Bill of Rights," and
seized Fort Garry. An ill-judged attempt on the part of some of the
loyal settlers to compel the release of certain prisoners failed, and
the leader, Major Boulton, with Thomas Scott and others, was captured.
Boulton was released, but Riel caused Scott to be shot. Intense
indignation throughout Canada was aroused by this act, and the
government at once organized an expeditionary force, under Colonel
Wolseley. The force proceeded by way of the lakes, and the Dawson route
from Fort William to Lake Winnipeg. Wolseley reached Fort Garry on Aug.
24, 1870, to find that Riel, with his lieutenants Lepine and O'Donoghue,
had fled across the border. Riel was subsequently outlawed. =Index=: =C=

=Riel Rebellion=, 1885. The land question, which had given rise to the
Red River Rebellion of 1869-1870, was also responsible for the
Saskatchewan Rebellion of 1885. The government had neglected to issue
patents to the half-breeds on the Saskatchewan, and they became
convinced that their lands would be taken from them. Riel was sent for,
and an agitation worked up, at first along peaceful lines, but rapidly
moving towards violence. Riel finally threw discretion to the winds, and
deliberately inflamed not only the half-breeds, but also the western
tribes. A small detachment of Mounted Police and volunteers was attacked
at Duck Lake, and the government at Ottawa, hitherto indifferent, awoke
to the seriousness of the situation. A force was organized, and sent
west under General Middleton. Middleton divided his force into three
columns; one under General Strange, to operate against Big Bear in the
neighbourhood of Edmonton; the second under Colonel Otter, to relieve
Battleford, which was threatened by Poundmaker; and the third, of which
he himself took command, to relieve Prince Albert. Middleton met the
rebels at Fish Creek, and experienced a stubborn resistance, but drove
them back to Batoche. Here Riel and his men held the troops at bay for
three days, but were finally routed and scattered. Meanwhile Otter had
encountered Poundmaker at Cut Knife Creek, and after a desperate fight
had been forced to retreat. In the far west, Strange had a similar
experience with Big Bear, but finally drove him to the north. Big Bear
gave himself up; Poundmaker and Riel were captured, and the latter paid
the penalty of his crimes on the scaffold. =Index=: _See also_ Riel.

entered the harbour of St. John's, Newfoundland, June 8, and there he
met Cartier on his way home. Sailing on into the gulf, and up the St.
Lawrence, he reached Charlesbourg Royal, where Cartier had wintered, and

wintered; explored the river in the spring; and sailed back to France

=Sable Island.= Off the coast of Nova Scotia. It was known from about
the beginning of the sixteenth century as Santa Cruz, and so appears on
Reinel's map of 1505, and on the Cabot _mappemonde_ of 1544. First
appears under its present name on a map of Joannes Freire, dated 1546.
Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed for the island in 1583, and lost one of his
ships among its treacherous shoals. He mentions that above thirty years
before, the Portuguese had placed neat cattle and swine upon it to
breed, and that these had multiplied exceedingly. In 1598 La Roche left
fifty convicts upon the island, while he explored the coast, but his
little ship was blown out to sea, and he returned to France without
them. Five years later a ship was sent out to rescue the survivors,
eleven in all. The earliest description of the island is in De Laet's
_Novus Orbis_, 1633. It is at present twenty miles long, by about a mile
wide, and is wasting away rapidly. At the end of the eighteenth century,
it was forty miles long by two and a half wide; and when white men first
visited the island, it must have been of quite a considerable size.
Records exist of something over 187 wrecks, and this does not begin to
represent the actual tribute in ships to this "Graveyard of the
Atlantic." =Bib.=: Patterson, _Sable Island: Its History and Phenomena_

=Seigniorial Tenure.= The history of this feudal system of land tenure,
transplanted from Old to New France, dates back to the commission of the
Sieur de la Roche, 1598, in which he is empowered to make grants in the

the Company of New France (or the Company of One Hundred Associates) was
chartered, only three seigniories had been granted, two to colonial
laymen and the third to the Jesuit Order. Thereafter a large number of
seigniorial grants were made--no less than sixty between 1632 and 1663,
when the Company surrendered its rights to the crown. Details as to the
later history of Seigniorial Tenure in Canada, how it was applied to the
land, and why it outlived the same system in Old France, will be found

McKay, one of the partners of Astor's company, Thorn sailed north on a
trading expedition. At Nootka, while trading with the natives, he struck
one of the principal chiefs and turned him out of the ship. A few days
later a large party of Indians came on board, ostensibly to trade, but
carrying concealed weapons. At a preconcerted signal, they fell on the
officers and crew, killing all but five seamen, who escaped into the
hold. Four of these escaped the following day in a boat, but perished at
sea. The natives, believing the ship deserted, come on board in a crowd
to pillage her. Suddenly, while four or five hundred were huddled
together on the deck, the ship blew up with a frightful noise. The
sailor who had remained behind, probably wounded, is supposed to have
taken this terrible revenge. An Indian of Gray's Harbour, who had been
among the crew, managed to escape during the massacre, and brought the
news to Astoria. =Index=: =D= Attacked by natives at Clayoquot Sound,

=Turner, Philip.= Entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company about
1779, and carried out important surveys for the Company. Stationed at
Cumberland House in 1789, and while there gave David Thompson
instruction in practical astronomy. Between 1790 and 1792 made a survey
of Lake Athabaska, and of the canoe route from Cumberland House to Great
Slave Lake. Dr. J. G. Kohl says that his manuscript journal of a
_Journey from Cumberland-house towards the Athapiscow Country and back
to York Factory, 1790-1792_, is preserved in the archives of the
Hudson's Bay Company at London. His map of this region, the original of
which is also in the Hudson's Bay Archives, is reproduced in Burpee's
_Search for the Western Sea_. His careful survey of Lake Athabaska was
important in that it corrected Peter Pond's crude map, which placed the
western end of the lake as far west as 131°, and so gave rise to the
impression that the lake was within easy reach of the Pacific Ocean.

=Vancouver Island.= The largest island on the west coast of North
America. Named after Captain George Vancouver, who explored this coast
in the years 1792-1794. The island was first named Quadra and Vancouver
in honour of the two naval officers who met at Nootka in 1792 to carry
out the provisions of the Nootka Convention. The first authentic landing
on the coast of the island is that of Captain James Cook in 1787.
Captain James Hanna landed at Nootka in 1785; and Captain John Meares in
1788. From this time trading and exploring expeditions spent more or
less time at Nootka. In 1843 the Hudson's Bay Company made their first
establishment on the island, Fort Victoria, at first known as Camosun.
The island remained under the control of the Company until 1849, when it
became a crown colony. Representative government was introduced, 1856;
and in 1866 the island and mainland were united under one government.

the discovery in Rome of a hitherto unknown version of the explorer's
report of his voyage. _See_ Bacchiani's article, with facsimile, in the

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
